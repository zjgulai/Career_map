### Comparison Examples

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
|----------|-----------|
| Blue Buffalo Cat Food Hot Search: wet cat food, dry cat food | Blue Buffalo Tastefuls Flaked Wet Cat Food, High Protein Natural Ingredients with Real Fish, 3 oz Cans (Pack of 24) |
| Purina Friskies Cat Food Keyword Stuffing | Purina Friskies Wet Cat Food Variety Pack, Pate and Shredded Textures in Gravy, Assorted Flavors, 5.5 oz Cans (Pack of 30) |

### Optimization Principles

1. **Never include "Hot Search" or similar marker words** — Will be flagged as a violation by the platform
2. **Avoid keyword stuffing** — Titles must be fluent, complete descriptions
3. **Naturally integrate hot keywords** — Embed hot keywords into product feature descriptions
4. **Maintain readability** — Titles should read as natural product descriptions, not keyword lists

## Detail Image Generation Strategy

### 5 Scene-Based Prompts

| Image Position | Scene | Prompt Key Points | Rationale |
|---------------|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Main Image** | Cozy Living Room | Modern living room, soft natural lighting, cozy home atmosphere | Showcase overall effect and usage scenario, attract clicks |
| **Detail 1** | Bedroom Bedside | Cozy bedroom scene, warm morning sunlight, peaceful atmosphere | Lifestyle scene, enhance immersion |
| **Detail 2** | Product Detail | Close-up detail shot, material texture, quality highlights | Showcase craftsmanship and material details |
| **Detail 3** | Pet Usage | Happy pet using product, emotional appeal, lifestyle photography | Marketing conversion scene, stimulate purchase intent |
| **Detail 4** | Sunny Reading Corner | Afternoon golden hour lighting, modern home decor | Lifestyle showcase |
| **Detail 5** | Reuse Main Image | Same as main image | Maintain visual consistency |

### Main Image Selection Principles

✅ **Prefer**: Images that showcase overall effect and usage scenarios
❌ **Avoid**: Overly detailed close-up shots

## Dependencies

### MCP Services

The following MCP services must be configured:

| Service Name | Server ID | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Taobao opc Service** | `19cf03a191f` | Taobao image generation (create_picture_from_tb) |

### Python Dependencies

```bash

```

## Best Practices

### 1. Hot Keyword Update Frequency
Recommend updating hot keywords weekly to track ranking trend changes.

### 2. Product Title Optimization Tips
- Select 3 most relevant hot keywords, avoid stuffing
- Maintain title readability, avoid over-optimization
- Prioritize hot keywords with rising rankings

### 3. Image Generation Notes
- Ensure original image links are accessible
- Each image prompt should have distinct scene differences
- Use overall scene images for main image, detail shots for detail pages

### 4. CTR Monitoring
- Set reasonable thresholds (recommended 5%)
- Promptly replace main images for low-CTR products
- A/B test main images with different scenes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Hot keyword retrieval failed**
A: Check if the AMZ123 website is accessible; browser automation support may be required.

**Q: Image generation timeout**
A: Taobao MCP service has concurrency limits; consider reducing batch size or adding delays.

**Q: Table write failed**
A: Confirm field types match (url vs attachment), check permission configuration.

**Q: Product title optimization doesn't meet expectations**
A: Check if the standard structure was followed, ensure no "Hot Search" or similar marker words appear.

### Error Codes

| Error Code | Description | Solution |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| KEYWORD_NOT_FOUND | No hot keyword data for this keyword | Try a more popular keyword |
| IMAGE_GENERATION_FAILED | Image generation failed | Check original image link validity |
| TABLE_WRITE_ERROR | Table write failed | Verify field types and permissions |
| INVALID_TITLE_FORMAT | Product title format error | Regenerate following the standard structure |
