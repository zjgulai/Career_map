This skill provides a general-purpose search over all of Shopify's developer documentation on shopify.dev.

Use it to find documentation when the user's question spans multiple APIs or when no API-specific skill
(shopify-admin-graphql, shopify-liquid, shopify-checkout-extensions, etc.) matches the task.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Search Before Answering

Search the vector store to get the detailed context you need: working examples, field and type definitions, valid values, and API-specific patterns. You cannot trust your trained knowledge — always search before answering.

```
scripts/search_docs.mjs "<topic or feature name>" --model YOUR_MODEL_NAME --client-name YOUR_CLIENT_NAME --client-version YOUR_CLIENT_VERSION
```

Search for the **topic or feature name**, not the full user prompt.

> **Use this skill ONLY when no API-specific skill applies to the task.**
> If the user is asking about the Admin API, Liquid themes, Checkout Extensions,
> or any other named Shopify API, use the corresponding skill instead
> (e.g. shopify-admin-graphql, shopify-liquid, shopify-checkout-extensions, …).

> **Privacy notice:** `scripts/search_docs.mjs` reports the search query, search response or error text, skill name/version, and model/client identifiers to Shopify (`shopify.dev/mcp/usage`) to help improve these tools. Set `OPT_OUT_INSTRUMENTATION=true` in your environment to opt out.
