# iFinD

Use this skill to answer questions that require iFinD financial market data.

## Setup

Check whether the agent-gw Python SDK is available in the current Python environment, and install it only if the check fails:

```bash
python3 -c "import agent_gw" || python3 -m pip install "$(curl -s https://cdn.kimi.com/agentgw/pysdk/manifest.json | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['latest']['url'])")"
```

The SDK needs an API key from `[REDACTED]`, `KIMI_API_KEY`, or
`~/.kimi/agent-gw.json`.

## Workflow

1. Run `python3 scripts/ifind_tool.py describe` from the plugin directory to call
   `get_data_source_desc({"name": "ifind"})`.
2. Read the returned Markdown carefully. It contains the overall data source
   rules, ticker/security formats, market coverage, global constraints, and each
   API's description, required parameters, optional parameters, defaults, and
   allowed values.
3. Select the API that best matches the user's question.
4. Build `params` exactly from the Markdown requirements. Pay attention to market,
   ticker, date range, report period, statement type, currency, and frequency
   requirements.
5. Use `python3 scripts/ifind_tool.py call` to call `call_data_source_tool`.
6. If the call fails, explain the failure reason from the response.
7. If the call succeeds, save any returned files first, then answer using
   `resp.result.assistant`; ignore `resp.result.user` unless display content is
   specifically needed.

## Common Use Cases

- Stock profile and security lookup across China A-shares, Hong Kong, US, and
  other supported markets.
- Financial statements, including balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow.
- Business segmentation, operating indicators, announcements, holder information,
  and analyst forecasts.
- Historical or current price data and market analysis.
- Intelligent stock screening with multi-dimensional filters.

## Script

Use the bundled script from the plugin directory:

```bash
python3 scripts/ifind_tool.py describe
```

After reading the Markdown and selecting an API:

```bash
python3 scripts/ifind_tool.py call \
  --api-name "<api name from markdown>" \
  --params-json '{"required_param":"value"}'
```

For larger params, write a JSON object and pass
`--params-file path/to/params.json`.

The script:

- sends `{"name": "ifind"}` to `get_data_source_desc`
- sends `{"data_source_name": "ifind", "api_name": ..., "params": ...}` to
  `call_data_source_tool`
- prints failure messages from `error.user` or `error.assistant`
- saves returned files to each `files[].name` path returned by the data source
- prints the joined `result.assistant` texts on success

Expected `call_data_source_tool` response shape:

```python
{
    "is_success": bool,
    "result": {"user": list[str], "assistant": list[str]} | None,
    "error": {"user": list[str], "assistant": list[str]} | None,
    "files": [{"name": str, "content": str}],
}
```

When files are returned, `name` is the file path or name to write. The path is
usually dictated by the selected API's params in the Markdown docs. If an API
does not need files, the response normally has no files to save.
