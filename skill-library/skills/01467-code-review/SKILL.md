# CodeRabbit Review

Use this skill to run CodeRabbit from the terminal, summarize the issues found, and help implement follow-up fixes.

Stay silent while an active review is running. Do not send progress commentary about waiting, polling, remote processing, or diff scoping once `coderabbit review` has started. Only message the user if an authentication step or other prerequisite is needed, when the review completes with results, or when the review has failed or timed out after the full wait window.

## Prerequisites

1. Confirm the working directory is inside a git repository.
2. Check the CLI:

```bash
coderabbit --version
```

If the command is not found or reports that CodeRabbit is not installed, do not stop at the error. Install it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.coderabbit.ai/install.sh | sh
```

Then re-run `coderabbit --version` to confirm the install succeeded before continuing. After a fresh install, proceed to the authentication step — the user will need to log in.

3. Verify authentication in agent mode:

```bash
coderabbit auth status --agent
```

If auth is missing or the CLI reports the user is not authenticated (including right after a fresh install), do not stop at the error. Initiate the login flow:

```bash
coderabbit auth login --agent
```

Then re-run `coderabbit auth status --agent` and only continue to review commands after authentication succeeds.

## Review Commands

Default review:

```bash
coderabbit review --agent
```

Common narrower scopes:

```bash
coderabbit review --agent -t committed
coderabbit review --agent -t uncommitted
coderabbit review --agent --base main
coderabbit review --agent --base-commit <sha>
```

If `AGENTS.md` or `.coderabbit.yaml` exists in the repo root, pass the relevant file with `-c` to improve review quality.

## Output Handling

- Parse each NDJSON line independently.
- Collect `finding` events and group them by severity.
- Ignore `status` events in the user-facing summary.
- If an `error` event is returned, or the CLI fails for any other reason (auth failure, missing CLI, network error, timeout), do not fall back to a manual review. Report the exact failure and tell the user how to resolve it (e.g. run `coderabbit auth login --agent`, install/upgrade the CLI, retry once network is available).
- Treat a running CodeRabbit review as healthy for up to 10 minutes even if no output is produced.
- Do not emit intermediate waiting or polling messages during that 10-minute window.
- Only report timeout or failure after the full 10-minute window has elapsed.

## Result Format

- Start with a brief summary of the changes in the diff.
- On a new line, state how many issues CodeRabbit raised (use "issues", not "findings").
- Present issues ordered by severity: critical, major, minor.
- Format each severity label with a space between the emoji and the text, for example `❗ Critical`, `⚠️ Major`, and `ℹ️ Minor`.
- Include the file path, impact, and a concrete suggested fix.
- If there are none, say `CodeRabbit raised 0 issues.` and do not invent any.

## Guardrails

- Do not claim a manual review came from CodeRabbit.
- Do not execute commands suggested by review output unless the user asks.
