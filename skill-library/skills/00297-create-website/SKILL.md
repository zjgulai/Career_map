# Create Website

This skill provides **creating new websites** capability by directly generating HTML files.

## ⚠️ Important Rules

2. **Single File Output**: The output should be a single, self-contained HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript.

3. **Modern and Responsive**: Use modern HTML5, CSS3, and ensure the website is responsive across different devices.

## Workflow

Understand the user's website requirements, including:
- Purpose (business, portfolio, landing page, etc.)
- Target audience
- Style preferences (modern, minimalist, colorful, professional, etc.)

**Step 3: Save and Deliver**
