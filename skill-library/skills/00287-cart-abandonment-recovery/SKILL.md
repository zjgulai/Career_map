# Recover Abandoned Carts with Automated Sequences

## Overview

Cart abandonment is a significant revenue leak, averaging 70% across e-commerce. Automated recovery sequences are among the highest-ROI automations available. A balanced strategy uses multiple channels (email and SMS) to remind shoppers of their interest, add urgency, and provide incentives only as a last resort.

## When to Use This Skill

- When your initiated checkout completion rate is below 50%.
- When you want to decrease the cost per acquisition (CPA) by converting existing traffic.
- When launching a new store and prioritizing baseline revenue recovery.
- When current flat-discount emails are training customers to abandon for a code.
- When segmenting recovery based on high-value vs. low-value carts.

## Core Instructions

### Step 1: Platform-Native Configuration

#### Shopify
1.  **Enable Built-in Emails:** Go to **Settings → Checkout → Abandoned checkouts**.
2.  **Toggle:** Check "Automatically send abandoned checkout emails".
3.  **Delay:** Set the first delay to 1 hour (recommended).
4.  **Template:** Customize your email branding under **Notifications → Abandoned checkout**.

#### WooCommerce & BigCommerce
1.  Configure native abandonment settings in the platform's Admin area.
2.  Ensure that order status updates correctly to "Cancelled" or "Completed" to prevent recovery emails from being sent to customers who have already paid.

### Step 2: The 4-Message Sequence Structure

Follow this sequence to maximize recovery without damaging brand perception or margin:

1.  **Message 1 — Reminder (1 hour later):**
    *   **Channel:** Email.
    *   **Content:** "You forgot something." Show cart items with high-quality images.
    *   **Incentive:** No discount. Simple reminder only.
2.  **Message 2 — Social Proof/Urgency (4–6 hours later):**
    *   **Channel:** Email or Push.
    *   **Content:** "Items are selling fast" or "Customer Review of [Item in Cart]."
    *   **Incentive:** No discount. Focus on value and scarcity.
3.  **Message 3 — Small Incentive (24 hours later):**
    *   **Channel:** Email.
    *   **Content:** "Still thinking about it? Here is free shipping (or 10% off) for 48 hours."
    *   **Incentive:** Use a unique, single-use code that expires.
4.  **Message 4 — Final Push (48 hours later):**
    *   **Channel:** SMS (only if opted-in).
    *   **Content:** "Your cart and discount expire tomorrow. Finish your purchase here: [Link]."
    *   **Incentive:** Final reminder of the Message 3 discount.

> **Rule:** Never send more than 4 messages. Stop immediately if the customer completes a purchase.

### Step 3: Flow Logic Diagram

This logic can be implemented across any marketing automation platform:

```
Trigger: "Checkout Started" (or "Cart Abandoned")
  ↓
Filter: "Has not placed order since starting flow"
  ↓
Wait 1 Hour → Send Reminder Email
  ↓
Wait 5 Hours → Send Urgency Email (Filter: "Has not placed order")
  ↓
Wait 19 Hours → Send Discount Email (Filter: "Has not placed order")
  ↓
Wait 24 Hours → Send Final SMS (Filter: "Has not placed order" AND "Is opted-in for SMS")
```

### Step 4: Decision Criteria & Deepening

#### Cart Value Segmentation Strategy
Not all carts are equal. Implement different sequences based on cart value:
*   **High-Value Cart (>$200):** Use shorter delays and more personalized "human" emails (e.g., "From the Founder"). Offer higher incentives (e.g., $25 off) earlier.
*   **Low-Value Cart (<$50):** Use longer delays and only offer free shipping as an incentive.

#### Exit-Intent Popup Timing
Capture emails *before* the customer leaves the site:
*   **Trigger:** Show an exit-intent popup when a user’s cursor moves toward the browser close button.
*   **Incentive:** Offer a small discount in exchange for an email. If the user accepts but doesn't buy, they immediately enter the recovery sequence.

#### A/B Testing Framework for Incentives
Test these variables to find the "Incentive Sweet Spot":
*   **Timing:** Try offering the discount at 12 hours vs. 24 hours.
*   **Type:** Try "10% Off" vs. "Free Shipping" vs. "$10 Off."
*   **Subject Lines:** Test question-based vs. urgency-based subject lines.

### Step 5: Benchmarks for Success

| Metric | Target | Best-in-Class |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Recovery Rate (Email) | 3-7% | >10% |
| Recovery Rate (SMS) | 10-15% | >20% |
| Open Rate | 40-50% | >60% |
| Overall Abandonment | <70% | <60% |

## Best Practices

- **Start Without a Discount:** 30-50% of recoveries happen at Message 1 without any incentive. Avoid training your customers to abandon on purpose.
- **Single-Use Codes:** Always generate unique, one-time discount codes rather than generic "WELCOME10" codes.
- **In-Email Cart View:** The email must dynamically show the actual products left in the cart to be effective.
- **Respect Opt-outs:** Ensure a clear "Unsubscribe" link is present in every email and "STOP" is available for SMS.

## Common Pitfalls

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Emails sent after purchase | Set a flow filter to re-verify "Ordered zero times since starting flow" before every single message send. |
| Revealing discounts too early | If recovery revenue is high but margin is low, move the discount from Message 3 to Message 4 (or remove it). |
| Serial abandoners | Use logic to exclude customers who have abandoned more than 3 times in 30 days from receiving discounts. |
| SMS spamming | Only send 1 SMS per sequence. Excessive SMS recovery results in high unsubscribe rates and carrier blocks. |
