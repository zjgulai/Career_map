# Amazon Hot Keywords Scraper

Scrape ABA weekly search term rankings from AMZ123 for any keyword. Outputs structured CSV data with search term, current week rank, last week rank, and trend direction.

## How It Works

The skill uses a Selenium-based scraper (`scripts/amz_scraper.py`) to:
1. Open AMZ123's US top keywords page in headless Chrome
2. Search for the user-specified keyword
3. Extract up to 200 related search terms with their weekly rankings
4. Calculate trend (up/down/flat) by comparing current vs. last week rank
5. Save results as a timestamped CSV file

## Usage

Run the scraper script with the target keyword:

```bash
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/amz_scraper.py --keyword "dog bed"
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description | Example |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `--keyword` | Yes | Search keyword | `--keyword "yoga mat"` |
| `--max-results` | No | Max results to scrape (default: 200) | `--max-results 100` |
| `--output-dir` | No | Output directory for CSV (default: current dir) | `--output-dir ./data` |

### Output

The script produces a CSV file named `amz123_hotwords_<keyword>_<timestamp>.csv` with columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| search_term | The keyword/search term |
| current_rank | This week's ranking position |
| last_rank | Last week's ranking position |
| trend | Calculated direction: up / down / flat / new |

Trend logic: rank number decreasing = rising popularity ("up"), rank number increasing = falling popularity ("down"), same = "flat", no previous rank = "new".

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Chrome browser installed
- Python packages: `selenium`, `pandas` (install via `pip3 install selenium pandas`)

ChromeDriver is auto-managed by Selenium 4.6+, so no manual driver installation needed.

## Troubleshooting

If the scraper returns empty results:
1. AMZ123 may have updated their page structure. Check the debug HTML file saved alongside the CSV for clues.
2. The CSS selectors in `scripts/amz_scraper.py` (see the `SELECTORS` dict) may need updating to match new class names.
3. Try running with `--headless false` to visually inspect what the page looks like.
