# Seasonal Campaign Automator

## Overview

Seasonal events—Black Friday/Cyber Monday (BFCM), Holiday Gifting, and Prime Day—often account for 30–50% of annual ecommerce revenue. The "Automator" approach focuses on building reusable promotional infrastructure that can be activated via schedule, reducing manual error and ensuring cross-channel synchronization. This skill covers the technical configuration of discounts, tiered access logic, and performance benchmarking for high-traffic peaks.

## Strategic Framework: The Seasonal Peak Timeline

| Phase | Timing | Objective | Key Activities |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Warm-up** | T-30 to T-14 | List Building & Domain Health | Lead gen ads, VIP list segmentation, email volume ramping. |
| **Teaser** | T-14 to T-1 | Anticipation & FOMO | "Save the date" emails, countdown timers, early carting. |
| **Peak** | T-0 to T+4 | Conversion Velocity | Automatic discounts live, SMS blasts, retargeting max-bid. |
| **Recovery** | T+5 to T+14 | Retention & Reviews | Review requests, "Extended Sale" for non-purchasers. |

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Automated Discount Configuration

Frictionless checkout is critical during high-traffic events. Use **Automatic Discounts** over coupon codes where possible to increase conversion rates by 10-15%.

#### Shopify Admin
1.  Navigate to **Discounts > Create Discount**.
2.  Select **Amount off products** or **Buy X get Y**.
3.  Choose **Automatic Discount** (no code required).
4.  **Scheduling:** Set the "Start date" and "End date" (e.g., Friday 12:00 AM to Monday 11:59 PM). Shopify will handle the site-wide activation and rollback automatically.

#### WooCommerce Admin
1.  Use the native **Coupons** interface for code-based sales.
2.  For automatic site-wide sales, use the **Bulk Edit** feature in the Products list to set "Sale Prices" with a scheduled date range (Sale price dates).
3.  **Edge Case:** If running a massive sale, ensure your hosting's object cache is cleared *immediately* after the sale ends to prevent users from seeing "zombie" sale prices.

#### Amazon Seller Central
1.  Go to **Advertising > Prime Exclusive Discounts** or **Coupons**.
2.  Schedule "Percentage Off" for the specific event window. Note: Amazon requires a minimum of 20% off for Prime Day/BFCM placement.

### Step 2: Tiered Access & VIP Logic

Reward your highest-LTV customers to secure early revenue and reduce "out-of-stock" risk for your best patrons.

1.  **VIP Early Access (T-24h):** Send a unique link or early-access password to customers with >2 lifetime orders.
2.  **Waitlist Early Access (T-2h):** Send a "Sale is live for you" SMS to those who opted in during the warm-up phase.
3.  **Public Launch (T-0):** Enable the site-wide automatic discount.

### Step 3: Performance Guardrails (Edge Cases)

- **Inventory Buffer:** Set "Low Stock Alerts" to trigger at 15% of total inventory during sales. If an item sells out, immediately switch the "Add to Cart" button to a "Notify Me for Restock" form.
- **Site Load:** Disable non-essential scripts (heatmaps, secondary tracking pixels) during the first 4 hours of BFCM to optimize server response times.
- **Margin Protection:** Use the formula: `Net Margin = (AOV * Gross Margin %) - CAC - Fulfillment`. If the discount depth (e.g., 40% off) reduces Net Margin to < 5%, pivot to "Free Gift with Purchase" to protect profitability.

## Benchmarks & Performance Targets

| Metric | Target (Good) | Target (Elite) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Seasonal Revenue Lift** | 3x Avg. Month | > 8x Avg. Month |
| **Email/SMS Share of Revenue** | 25% | > 45% |
| **Cart Abandonment Rate** | < 70% | < 55% |
| **New Customer Acquisition** | 40% of Total Sales | > 60% of Total Sales |

## Decision Criteria: Discount Depth vs. GWP

- **Deep Discount (30%+):** Use for "Inventory Clearing" or when entering a highly competitive market where price is the primary driver (e.g., Electronics).
- **Gift with Purchase (GWP):** Use for "Premium/Luxury" brands to maintain brand equity and protect margins. GWP often yields a 20% higher AOV than straight discounting.
- **Tiered Discount (Spend $X, Save $Y):** Best for "Basket Building." Target a spend threshold 20% higher than your current median AOV.

## Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

- **The "Pricing Hangover":** Forgetting to set an end date on discounts. Always verify the **Schedule** in your Admin before 12:00 AM on launch day.
- **Over-SMSing:** Sending more than 3 SMS in a 4-day period during BFCM leads to 500% higher unsubscribe rates. Limit SMS to "Launch" and "Last Call."
- **Customer Support Surge:** Ensure your Help Center has a "Sale FAQ" (Shipping times, Return policy) linked in every promotional email to reduce support ticket volume.
- **Inventory Mismatch:** If you sell on multiple channels (Shopify + Amazon), ensure your inventory sync tool is set to "Real-time" (1-5 min) to prevent overselling during high-velocity spikes.
