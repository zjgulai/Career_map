# TikTok Shop Setup

## Overview

TikTok Shop is a native commerce solution that allows users to discover and purchase products entirely within the TikTok app. Unlike traditional social ads that redirect to an external site, TikTok Shop provides a seamless, in-app checkout experience. This skill covers the technical integration of product catalogs, order fulfillment synchronization, and the management of the Creator Affiliate ecosystem.

## Strategic Operational Models

| Model | Fulfillment | Inventory Control | Best For |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Seller Managed** | You ship from your warehouse. | High (Shared with Web). | Established brands with existing 3PL. |
| **Fulfilled by TikTok (FBT)** | TikTok ships from their warehouse. | Low (Dedicated stock). | High-velocity viral products; brands seeking "Prime-like" badges on TikTok. |

### Decision Criteria: Viral Readiness
TikTok Shop is prone to "Viral Spikes" where a single video can generate 10,000+ orders in 24 hours. 
- **Capacity Check:** If your 3PL cannot scale to 5x daily volume within 48 hours, use **Fulfilled by TikTok** for your top 3 "Hero" SKUs to offload the surge.
- **Stock Buffering:** Set a 15% inventory reserve for TikTok in your sync logic to prevent overselling on your main website during a viral event.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Catalog Synchronization & Optimization

TikTok has strict content policies. Images with text overlays, watermarks, or "Price Tags" in the image will be rejected.

#### Technical Implementation (API / Custom)
```typescript
const TIKTOK_API_BASE = 'https://open-api.tiktokglobalshop.com';

// Sync a product variant to TikTok Shop
async function syncToTikTok(variant: any) {
  const payload = {
    title: variant.name.substring(0, 255),
    description: variant.description.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '').substring(0, 5000),
    category_id: "600101", // Electronics example
    brand_id: "700123",
    images: [{ url: variant.main_image }],
    skus: [{
      id: variant.sku,
      price: { amount: variant.price, currency: "USD" },
      inventory: [{ quantity: variant.stock, warehouse_id: "W_123" }]
    }]
  };
  
  // Requires HMAC-SHA256 signature for each request
  return await signedRequest(`${TIKTOK_API_BASE}/api/products`, payload);
}
```

#### Platform Configuration
- **Shopify/WooCommerce Admin:** Navigate to the "TikTok" Sales Channel. Connect your **Seller Center** account. Ensure "Inventory Sync" is set to "Real-time."
- **Attribute Mapping:** Map your platform's "Product Type" to TikTok's mandatory "Category IDs." Misalignment here is the #1 cause of "Under Review" status.

### Step 2: The Affiliate Creator Engine

The "Affiliate Center" is the primary growth driver on TikTok Shop.

1.  **Open Plan:** Set a baseline commission (e.g., 10%) for all creators. This allows anyone to add your product to their "Showcase."
2.  **Targeted Plan:** Invite specific high-performing creators with an elevated commission (e.g., 20-30%) and provide "Free Samples" directly through the Seller Center interface.
3.  **Performance Tiers:** Implement a tiered structure—creators who generate >$5,000 in GMV get a +5% commission bonus and early access to new product launches.

### Step 3: LIVE Shopping Orchestration

LIVE events combine entertainment with "Flash Sale" urgency.

- **Product Pinning:** During a LIVE, use the "Shopping Bag" icon to "Pin" products as they are being demonstrated. Pinned products see a 300% higher Click-through Rate (CTR).
- **Exclusive Coupons:** Create "LIVE-Only" coupons in the Seller Center (Promotions > Live Coupons) that expire as soon as the stream ends to drive immediate checkout.

### Step 4: Fulfillment & SLA Compliance

TikTok enforces a strict **"Dispatch Sla"** (usually 48 hours). 
1.  **Sync Orders:** Orders from TikTok must flow into your Warehouse Management System (WMS) immediately.
2.  **Label Generation:** Use TikTok-generated labels or ensure your 3PL uploads tracking numbers within the 48-hour window. Failure to do so will result in "Violation Points" and eventual shop suspension.

## Benchmarks & Performance Targets

| Metric | Target (Good) | Target (Elite) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **GMV per LIVE Hour** | $500 | > $5,000 |
| **Affiliate GMV %** | 30% of Total | > 70% of Total |
| **Late Shipment Rate** | < 2.0% | < 0.5% |
| **Product Approval Rate** | > 85% | > 98% |

## Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

- **Shadowbanning / Content Violations:** TikTok may "hide" your products if your videos contain "Restricted Claims" (e.g., "Cures acne" or "Instant weight loss"). Keep medical/health claims strictly to what is on the FDA-approved label.
- **Inventory Latency:** If you have 1 unit left and it sells on Shopify and TikTok at the same time. **Mitigation:** Implement a "Safety Stock" of 2-3 units that are never synced to TikTok.
- **Commission Stacking:** Be careful when combining "Affiliate Commission" with "Shop Coupons." Ensure your net margin can sustain both (e.g., 20% commission + 20% coupon = 40% margin hit).
- **Return Rate Spikes:** TikTok buyers often buy based on impulse. Expect a 5-10% higher return rate on TikTok compared to your website. Factor this into your GPM (Gross Profit Margin) calculations.
