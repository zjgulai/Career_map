# Code Simplifier

This skill launches the `code-simplifier` subagent (provided by the `code-simplifier@claude-plugins-official` plugin installed in user scope) to simplify and refine code while preserving all functionality.

## When to Use

- After implementing a feature or bug fix, to clean up the resulting code
- When code has grown overly complex and needs simplification
- When the user requests code cleanup, simplification, or readability improvements
- To remove unnecessary abstractions, redundant logic, or dead code
- To improve naming, reduce nesting, and streamline control flow

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Target Files

Determine which files to simplify. By default, focus on recently modified files in the current branch:

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD~1  # Files changed in last commit
git diff --name-only         # Uncommitted changes
```

If the user specifies particular files or directories, use those instead.

### Step 2: Launch the Subagent

Invoke the `code-simplifier` subagent via the Task tool with `subagent_type: "code-simplifier"`:

```
Task tool call:
  subagent_type: "code-simplifier"
  description: "Simplify recently modified code"
  prompt: "Simplify and refine the following files: <file list>. Preserve all existing functionality."
```

The subagent is an Opus-powered specialist that:
- Preserves exact functionality while improving how code is written
- Applies project standards from CLAUDE.md (ES modules, naming conventions, etc.)
- Reduces unnecessary complexity and nesting
- Avoids nested ternary operators, preferring switch/if-else for clarity
- Chooses clarity over brevity

### Step 3: Prompt Construction

Include in the prompt:
- The specific files or code areas to simplify
- Any constraints (e.g., "preserve the public API", "do not change test files")
- The type of simplification needed (e.g., "reduce nesting", "improve naming", "remove dead code")

#### Example Invocations

**After a feature implementation:**
```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "code-simplifier"
  description: "Simplify header factory code"
  prompt: "Simplify the recently modified files in the current branch. Files: src/webview/factories/HeaderFactory.ts, src/webview/managers/UIManager.ts. Preserve all functionality. Focus on reducing complexity and improving readability."
```

**Targeted cleanup:**
```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "code-simplifier"
  description: "Simplify TerminalManager dispose"
  prompt: "Simplify src/terminal/TerminalManager.ts. The dispose() method has grown too complex. Reduce nesting, extract helper functions if needed, and improve variable naming. Do not change the public API."
```

**Branch-wide cleanup:**
```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "code-simplifier"
  description: "Simplify all changed files"
  prompt: "Review and simplify all TypeScript files changed in the current branch compared to main. Run: git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- '*.ts' to find changed files. Preserve all functionality and tests."
```

### Step 4: Review Results

After the subagent completes:
1. Review the changes for correctness
2. Run tests to verify functionality is preserved: `npm run test:unit`
3. Run the linter to verify code quality: `npm run lint`
