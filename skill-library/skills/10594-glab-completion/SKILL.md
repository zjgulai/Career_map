# glab completion

## 概览

```

  This command outputs code meant to be saved to a file, or immediately                                                 
  evaluated by an interactive shell. To load completions:

  To load completions in your current shell session:

  To load completions for every new session, run this command one time:

  If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you must                                               
  enable it. Run this command one time:

  For older versions of macOS, you might need this command:

  The Homebrew version of glab should install completions automatically.

  ### PowerShell                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                        
  To load completions in your current shell session:                                                                    
                                                                                                                        
  ```shell                                                                                                              
  glab completion -s powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression                                                        
  ```                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                        
  To load completions for every new session, add the output of the above command                                        
  to your PowerShell profile.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                        
  When installing glab through a package manager, however, you might not need                                           
  more shell configuration to support completions.
