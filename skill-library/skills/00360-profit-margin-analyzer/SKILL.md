# Profit Margin Analyzer

## Overview

Profit margin analysis is the process of decomposing revenue into its cost components to identify exactly where value is created or destroyed. In ecommerce, a high-revenue product can often be a "loss leader" once fulfillment, marketing, and returns are factored in. This skill focuses on moving beyond basic gross margin to **Contribution Margin**, providing the data necessary for catalog rationalization and pricing strategy.

## The Profit Waterfall Model

Use this standardized hierarchy for all profitability assessments:

```text
Gross Revenue (List Price × Units)
  - Discounts/Promotions
  - Returns & Refunds
= Net Revenue

  - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS - Landed)
= Gross Profit (Gross Margin %)

  - Payment Processing Fees (e.g., 2.9% + $0.30)
  - Marketplace Referral Fees (e.g., Amazon 15%)
  - Outbound Shipping & Packaging
  - Fulfillment Labor/FBA Fees
= Fulfillment-Adjusted Gross Profit

  - Variable Marketing Spend (Ad Spend per SKU/Channel)
= Contribution Margin (Contribution Margin %)

  - Fixed Overhead (SaaS, Rent, Salaries)
= Operating Profit (Net Margin %)
```

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Data Sanitization (Landed Cost Calculation)

The most common error in margin analysis is using "wholesale price" instead of "landed cost."

**Formula for Landed Cost per Unit:**
`Landed Cost = (Unit Purchase Price) + (Inbound Freight / Total Units) + (Customs/Duties / Total Units) + (Prep/Inspection Fees / Total Units)`

#### Platform Configuration:
- **Shopify Admin:** Navigate to **Products > [Product] > Variants**. Ensure the **Cost per item** field reflects the *Landed Cost*. Use the "Profit by product" report in **Analytics > Reports** to view baseline gross margins.
- **WooCommerce Admin:** Use the native **Cost of Goods** fields (if enabled via extension) or custom attributes to store landed cost.
- **Amazon Seller Central:** Review the **Fee Preview** in Manage Inventory to see the breakdown of Referral vs. FBA fees per SKU.

### Step 2: Channel-Level Profitability Mapping

Compare performance across different sales environments. Note that high-volume channels like Amazon often have lower margins due to referral fees but higher efficiency.

| Metric | Shopify (DTC) | Amazon FBA | Wholesale |
|--------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| **Avg. Order Value** | $85.00 | $42.00 | $1,200.00 |
| **Platform Fee** | 0% (SaaS) | 15% (Referral) | 0% |
| **Fulfillment** | $12.50 (Self) | $6.40 (FBA) | $45.00 (LTL) |
| **Gross Margin %** | 72% | 45% | 35% |
| **Contribution %** | 42% | 22% | 28% |

**Decision Criterion:** If a channel's Contribution Margin % is lower than your target CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), you are losing money on every new customer acquired through that channel.

### Step 3: SKU Tiering & Catalog Rationalization

Categorize your products based on volume and contribution margin to determine resource allocation.

1.  **High Margin / High Volume (Stars):** Prioritize for ad spend and influencer seeding.
2.  **Low Margin / High Volume (Workhorses):** Target for COGS negotiation or shipping optimization. Do not increase ad spend here.
3.  **High Margin / Low Volume (Niche):** Keep for "basket builders" or bundles.
4.  **Low Margin / Low Volume (Dogs):** Candidate for discontinuation or significant price increases.

### Step 4: Advanced Cost Attribution (Edge Cases)

- **Return Rate Impact:** A 15% return rate on a 40% margin product effectively reduces the margin to ~30% when accounting for non-resellable inventory and shipping losses.
- **Currency Fluctuation:** If buying in USD but selling in EUR, a 5% currency shift can wipe out your net profit. Build a 5-10% "buffer" into COGS for international sourcing.
- **Bundling Logic:** Calculate the "Weighted Average Margin" for bundles. Often, bundling a high-margin accessory with a low-margin core product is the only way to make the core product profitable.

## Benchmarks & Decision Thresholds

| Indicator | Danger Zone | Healthy | Elite |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Gross Margin** | < 30% | 50% - 65% | > 75% |
| **Contribution Margin** | < 15% | 25% - 40% | > 50% |
| **Net Profit Margin** | < 2% | 8% - 15% | > 20% |
| **Return Rate (Hard Goods)** | > 12% | 3% - 7% | < 2% |

## Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring Payment Fees:** Payment processors take ~3% of *Gross* revenue, not Net. On a low-margin product, this can be 10-15% of your actual profit.
- **Flat Shipping Assumptions:** Shipping a heavy item to Zone 8 (far) vs. Zone 2 (near) can vary by $15. Use *Weighted Average Shipping Cost* based on historical shipping data, not just the "standard" rate.
- **Inventory Write-offs:** Ensure "Dead Stock" (inventory older than 180 days) is factored into your annual COGS as a write-down.
