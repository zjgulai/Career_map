# Supplier Performance Manager

## Overview

Reliable supply chain operations are built on structured vendor management. Beyond simply placing orders, effective "Performance Management" involves tracking lead times, fill rates, and quality consistency to mitigate stockout risks and negotiate better terms. This skill focuses on the technical workflow of Purchase Orders (POs), receipt reconciliation, and data-driven supplier evaluation.

## Strategic Sourcing Framework

| Metric | Definition | Benchmark |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Fill Rate** | % of ordered units actually received. | > 95% |
| **On-Time Delivery** | % of POs delivered within the quoted lead time. | > 90% |
| **Defect Rate** | % of units rejected during Quality Control (QC). | < 1.5% |
| **Lead Time Variance** | Standard deviation of historical delivery times. | < 3 Days |

### Decision Criteria: Domestic vs. International Sourcing
- **Domestic:** Higher unit cost but lower lead times (3-7 days). Best for "Trending" products with high demand volatility.
- **International:** Lower unit cost but high lead times (30-90 days) and increased risk (Customs, Port delays). Best for "Stable" hero products with predictable demand.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Standardized Purchase Order (PO) Issuance

A PO is a legal contract. Every PO must contain:
1.  **Unique PO Number:** (e.g., PO-2026-001).
2.  **SKU Mapping:** Your Internal SKU + Supplier's SKU.
3.  **Agreed Unit Cost:** To prevent "Invoice Creep."
4.  **Expected Ship Date:** Used to calculate the "On-Time" metric.

#### Technical Implementation (PO Schema)
```json
{
  "po_number": "PO-8829",
  "vendor_id": "VEND_001",
  "status": "OPEN",
  "items": [
    { "sku": "SHIRT-BLU-S", "qty_ordered": 500, "unit_cost": 4.50 },
    { "sku": "SHIRT-BLU-M", "qty_ordered": 750, "unit_cost": 4.50 }
  ],
  "expected_delivery_date": "2026-05-15",
  "incoterms": "FOB Shanghai"
}
```

### Step 2: Goods Receipt & QC Workflow

Never increment inventory based on a "Packing List." Always increment based on a "Physical Count."

1.  **The Dock Scan:** Scan items into a "Pending QC" location in your Warehouse Management System (WMS).
2.  **Discrepancy Check:**
    - **Shortages:** If 100 were ordered but only 90 arrived, keep the PO "Partial" and trigger a "Credit Memo" request.
    - **Quality Fade:** Compare the current batch against the "Golden Sample" from the first order. Document any deviations in material weight, color, or stitching.
3.  **Inventory Commit:** Only after QC approval should the stock be moved to "Available for Sale" in Shopify/WooCommerce.

### Step 3: Performance Scorecarding (Technical Logic)

Automate the calculation of supplier "Health" to drive quarterly business reviews (QBRs).

```typescript
async function calculateSupplierScore(vendorId: string) {
  const pos = await db.purchaseOrders.find({ vendor_id: vendorId, status: 'RECEIVED' });
  
  // On-Time % = (Orders Received <= Expected Date) / Total Orders
  const onTimeCount = pos.filter(p => p.actual_receipt <= p.expected_delivery).length;
  const onTimeRate = (onTimeCount / pos.length) * 100;

  // Fill Rate % = Total Units Received / Total Units Ordered
  const totalOrdered = pos.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.total_units_ordered, 0);
  const totalReceived = pos.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.total_units_received, 0);
  const fillRate = (totalReceived / totalOrdered) * 100;

  return { onTimeRate, fillRate, score: (onTimeRate * 0.5) + (fillRate * 0.5) };
}
```

### Step 4: Supply Chain Risk Mitigation

- **The "Safety Stock" Multiplier:** If a supplier has a Lead Time Variance of > 5 days, automatically increase the "Reorder Point" for their SKUs by 15%.
- **Ethical Compliance:** Maintain a digital vault of "Supplier Audits" (Social responsibility, Labor laws). Automate an "Expiry Alert" 30 days before a supplier's certification (e.g., ISO 9001) expires.

## Benchmarks & Performance Targets

| Indicator | Danger Zone | Healthy | Elite |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Fill Rate** | < 85% | 95% | > 99% |
| **On-Time Delivery** | < 70% | 90% | > 97% |
| **QC Rejection Rate** | > 5% | < 2% | < 0.5% |
| **Response Time (to PO)** | > 48 Hours | < 24 Hours | < 4 Hours |

## Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

- **"Zombie" POs:** Purchase orders left "Open" for months after partial delivery. **Solution:** Run a "PO Aging" report monthly and force-close any order > 60 days past its expected date.
- **Price Mismatches:** Supplier invoices $5.00 but PO says $4.50. **Mitigation:** Implement "Three-Way Matching" (PO vs. Receipt vs. Invoice). Do not pay the invoice until the discrepancy is resolved.
- **Over-Reliance on a Single Vendor:** If one supplier accounts for >60% of your revenue, you have a "Single Point of Failure." Actively source a "Back-up Supplier" for your top 5 SKUs.
- **Ignoring "Force Majeure":** Not having a plan for port strikes or regional holidays (e.g., Lunar New Year). Build a "Holiday Blackout" calendar into your demand forecasting to pull forward orders 4-6 weeks in advance.
