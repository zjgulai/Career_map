# /rune:ux-design-process -- UX Design Intelligence

UX-informed code review and planning support. Provides structured heuristic evaluation,
interaction pattern validation, flow analysis, and aesthetic quality assessment.

**Load skills**: `frontend-design-patterns`, `context-weaving`

## Configuration

UX design intelligence is gated by talisman configuration:

```yaml
# .rune/talisman.yml
ux:
  enabled: false            # Default: false (opt-in for initial release)
  cognitive_walkthrough: false  # Default: false (expensive -- uses Opus model)
  touch_target_minimum: 44  # px -- 48px recommended
  finding_prefix: true      # Emit UXH/UXF/UXI/UXC prefixed findings
  blocking: false           # UX findings are non-blocking by default
  industry: null            # Manual domain override for UXH scoring weights.
                            # Values: general, e-commerce, saas, fintech,
                            # healthcare, creative, education, content.
                            # When null, domain is auto-detected via
                            # inferProjectDomain() (requires confidence >= 0.70).
                            # See references/industry-weights.md for weight tables.
```

**Important**: `ux.enabled` defaults to `false`. Users must explicitly opt in via talisman.yml.
When the `ux:` section is missing entirely from talisman.yml, all UX features default to disabled (`enabled: false`, `cognitive_walkthrough: false`, `blocking: false`, `touch_target_minimum: 44`, `finding_prefix: true`).

## Process Routing

Determine project context and route to the appropriate UX process:

```
1. Check talisman.yml: ux.enabled === true
   - If false: exit with "UX intelligence is disabled. Enable via talisman.yml: ux.enabled: true"

2. Determine project context:
   - --greenfield flag OR no existing components/ directory → greenfield process
   - --brownfield flag OR existing components/ directory   → brownfield process
   - --audit flag                                          → heuristic audit (both processes)

3. Route:
   - Greenfield → see [greenfield-process.md](references/greenfield-process.md)
   - Brownfield → see [brownfield-process.md](references/brownfield-process.md)
   - Audit      → see [heuristic-checklist.md](references/heuristic-checklist.md)
```

## UX Finding Prefixes

All UX findings use standardized prefixes for integration with the Rune dedup hierarchy:

| Prefix | Domain | Agent | Description |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| `UXH` | Heuristic | ux-heuristic-reviewer | Nielsen/Baymard heuristic violations |
| `UXF` | Flow | ux-flow-validator | User flow breakages, dead ends, loops |
| `UXI` | Interaction | ux-interaction-auditor | Micro-interaction and state issues |
| `UXC` | Cognitive | ux-cognitive-walker | Cognitive load and learnability issues |

Severity levels per finding:

| Level | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| P0 | Blocks user flow | Form submit does nothing, nav leads to 404 |
| P1 | Degrades experience | Missing loading state, no error recovery |
| P2 | Cosmetic / improvement | Inconsistent spacing, suboptimal label text |

See [ux-scoring.md](references/ux-scoring.md) for the full scoring rubric.

## Architecture (3 Layers)

```
Layer 1: UX Research & Context  -- Understand user needs and project constraints
Layer 2: Evaluation & Analysis  -- Apply heuristics, validate flows, audit interactions
Layer 3: Scoring & Integration  -- Score findings, integrate with Rune review pipeline
```

## Layer 1: UX Research & Context

### Greenfield Projects

For new projects, the UX process covers user research, persona development, information
architecture, wireframing guidance, and visual design principles.

See [greenfield-process.md](references/greenfield-process.md) for the full greenfield workflow.

### Brownfield Projects

For existing codebases, the UX process covers heuristic evaluation, usability audit,
incremental improvement workflow, design debt assessment, and progressive enhancement.

See [brownfield-process.md](references/brownfield-process.md) for the full brownfield workflow.

## Layer 2: Evaluation & Analysis

### Heuristic Evaluation

50+ checklist items organized by Nielsen Norman's 10 heuristics, adapted from Baymard's
207 usability guidelines for code-level review context. Each item includes an ID, category,
description, code-level check instruction, and severity weight.

See [heuristic-checklist.md](references/heuristic-checklist.md) for the full checklist.

### UX Pattern Library

Catalog of UX patterns for agent guidance: loading states (skeleton, spinner, progressive),
error handling (inline, toast, modal, boundary), form validation, navigation patterns,
empty states, confirmation dialogs, and undo patterns.

See [ux-pattern-library.md](references/ux-pattern-library.md) for the pattern catalog.

### Interaction Patterns

Micro-interaction and state transition patterns: hover/focus/active states, loading
transitions, error recovery flows, optimistic updates, debounce/throttle, gesture
handling, scroll behavior, and drag-and-drop feedback.

See [interaction-patterns.md](references/interaction-patterns.md) for interaction patterns.

### Aesthetic Direction

Visual design principles for code-level enforcement: color coherence, typography hierarchy,
whitespace rhythm, visual weight balance, and contrast ratios (WCAG AA compliance).

See [aesthetic-direction.md](references/aesthetic-direction.md) for aesthetic principles.

### Web Interface Rules

Adapted from Vercel Web Interface Guidelines: semantic HTML, keyboard accessibility,
touch target sizes, responsive breakpoints, animation performance, reduced motion
preferences, and color-blind safe palettes.

See [web-interface-rules.md](references/web-interface-rules.md) for interface rules.

## Layer 3: Scoring & Integration

### Finding Severity

UX findings follow the UXH/UXF/UXI/UXC prefix scheme and are scored P0-P2.
UX prefixes are positioned below FRONT in the Rune dedup hierarchy.

See [ux-scoring.md](references/ux-scoring.md) for the scoring framework.

### Echo Persistence

When UX evaluation produces actionable findings, persist them with domain tagging:

```
const echoLib = `${RUNE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/echo-append.sh`
if (uxFindings.length > 0) {
  const patterns = uxFindings
    .filter(f => f.severity <= 1)  // P0 and P1 only
    .map(f => `- [${f.prefix}] ${f.title}`)
    .slice(0, 5)
    .join("\\n")

  Bash(`source "${echoLib}" && rune_echo_append \
    --role designer --layer inscribed \
    --source "rune:ux-design-process" \
    --title "UX patterns: ${projectContext}" \
    --content "${patterns}" \
    --confidence MEDIUM \
    --domain design \
    --tags "design,ux,heuristic"`)
}
```

### Integration with Rune Review Pipeline

UX review agents participate in the Roundtable Circle as conditional Ashes:

```
Activation: talisman.yml → ux.enabled === true
Trigger: changed files include frontend components (*.tsx, *.jsx, *.vue, *.svelte)
Position: After standard Wave 1 Ashes, before Wave 2 investigation
Blocking: false (by default -- configurable via talisman.yml → ux.blocking)
```

### Cognitive Walkthrough (Optional)

When `ux.cognitive_walkthrough: true`, the ux-cognitive-walker agent performs a
step-by-step cognitive walkthrough of user flows in changed components. This is
expensive (uses Opus model) and is OFF by default.

See [heuristic-checklist.md](references/heuristic-checklist.md) for cognitive walkthrough items.
