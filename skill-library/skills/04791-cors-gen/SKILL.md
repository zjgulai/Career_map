# CORS Generator

CORS errors are the bane of frontend development. Describe your setup and get the exact configuration you need for your stack.

**One command. Zero config. Just works.**

## Quick Start

```bash
npx ai-cors "frontend on localhost:3000, API on localhost:8080"
```

## What It Does

- Generates CORS config for your specific server/framework
- Handles complex setups with multiple origins
- Includes credentials, headers, and method configuration
- Works with Express, Fastify, Next.js, and more

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Local development
npx ai-cors "frontend on localhost:3000, API on localhost:8080"

# Production setup
npx ai-cors "React app on vercel, Express API on Railway"

# Multiple origins
npx ai-cors "allow requests from app.example.com and admin.example.com"

# With credentials
npx ai-cors "frontend on vercel, API on heroku, needs cookies"
```

## Best Practices

- **Be specific about origins** - don't use * in production
- **Allow only needed methods** - GET, POST, not everything
- **Consider credentials** - cookies require specific config
- **Test in incognito** - browser caching can hide issues

## When to Use This

- "CORS blocked" errors in the console
- Setting up a new API endpoint
- Migrating frontend or backend to new domain
- Adding authentication to an existing API
