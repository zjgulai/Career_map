name: kimi-slides
description: Create and edit presentations in PPTX format. This skill defines a .pptd intermediate format to simplify OOXML operations. Any task involving the generation or editing of PPTX files must use this skill and no other method. This skill can also be used to read uploaded PPTX files and convert PPTX documents into images. When the user requests an infographic or poster without specifying an image or HTML format, this skill may likewise be used to create it as a PPTX file.

# Definition
kimi-slides is a ppt-generation skill built by Moonshot AI as a first-party skill. It defines a YAML-format intermediate DSL (.pptd) that further abstracts OOXML, making presentation generation effortless. The DSL can be used to generate and render PPTs, and existing pptx files can also be converted into this DSL for editing.

## The pptd format
The .pptd format is a simplified abstraction layer over OOXML that follows basic YAML syntax. This abstraction preserves the core content of OOXML (theme, page layout, element positions and definitions, etc.) while removing complex nesting logic such as Masters; every page is self-contained — what you see is what you get. Read reference/pptd.md for the complete definition of this DSL.

## Companion CLI
The skill also ships with a companion CLI tool (pre-installed in the environment) for two-way conversion between pptd and pptx, pptd validation, pptd/pptx screenshot rendering, and more.
Read reference/cli.md for the complete CLI usage instructions.

## PPT production workflow

### step1. Read the context thoroughly
Read **all files uploaded by the user**, the provided URLs, and the pptd format guide `reference/pptd.md` to fully understand the user's requirements.

### step2. Understand the user's requirements
Understand the user's requirements based on the context:
1. First determine the purpose of the request
  - Create a PPT: create a new presentation (from scratch, or from an existing pptx template)
  - Edit a PPT: edit the user's uploaded PPT (local modifications, single-page beautification, etc.)
  - Replicate a PPT: replicate a presentation from a non-pptx format (images, PDF, etc.) into pptx format

2. Then determine the design direction
  - Self-directed design: no preference, or only simple style constraints given; you need to fill in or create the design
  - Design system: the user provides a complete and detailed design scheme covering all color, font, layout, and component specifications
  - Use a template: a template is provided and must be used
  - Style transfer: a style reference source is provided (images, web pages, etc.)

3. Then determine the input type
  - Topic only: only a PPT topic direction or content requirements for the presentation are given, with no concrete content
  - Full document: the user provides a complete document (paper, research report, press release, etc.)
  - Outline: the user provides a page-by-page outline, speech script, or similar content
  * When the "user input type" is [Full document] or [Outline] and it is not specified whether expansion is allowed: since a page-by-page outline, speech script, or user document can hardly support the full content of a presentation, prefer using search to expand with more relevant material, cases, etc., unless the user explicitly says not to expand

4. Page count
  - If the user requests a specific page count, the user's requirement takes priority
  - Page-by-page outline/script provided: match the number of pages in the outline/script
  - When a complete and relatively structured document is provided / when only a topic is provided: decide the page count yourself based on the document content / search results

### step3. Generate the presentation based on the user's requirements

Before generating, first read `reference/pptd.md` to understand the pptd format definition and constraints, and read `reference/cli.md` to learn how to use the companion CLI

#### Replicating a PPT
- Analyze the images to estimate element positions, fonts and sizes, etc., and **replicate 1:1 as closely as possible**.
- When an image contains elements that are hard to replicate directly and cannot be approximated with icons/shapes (e.g., photos, avatars), you may use tools such as bash or python to crop and screenshot the original image

#### Editing a PPT
- Convert the user's uploaded pptx file to .pptd format
- Take screenshots of the converted file, then stitch and compress the screenshots for an overview. Read a few key pages individually afterwards.
- Locate the pages to edit, and be careful not to affect parts outside the intended scope.
> The `kimi-slides convert` command is not a perfectly lossless conversion. If the user later reports format errors, garbled content, etc., compare against the original pptx and repair the pptd with reference to the comparison

#### Generating a PPT
When generating a PPT, adopt different production approaches for different user [design directions]
##### Self-directed design
1. Read the design guide `reference/slides_categories.md`, and read the scenario document corresponding to the user's query
2. Produce the presentation based on the above

#### Generating content in other formats
- When the user explicitly asks for an infographic, poster, or a highly visual single-page design, read `reference/general-poster.md` and implement it as a single-page or few-page editable PPTD; when the user only asks for an image, still build it with PPTD first, then output the image via screenshot or rendering. Do not load this reference file for ordinary PPT requests.

##### Design system
1. Read the general constraints section of the `reference/slides_categories.md` guide, and read the scenario document corresponding to the user's query as the design foundation
2. Read the user-provided design system document as the presentation style. It is strictly forbidden to reference or mix in other design styles
3. Produce the presentation with reference to the above

##### Using a template
1. Use `kimi-slides convert` to convert the user's uploaded pptx file into pptd form
2. Take screenshots of the converted file, then stitch and compress the screenshots for an overview to understand the template's visual style (color scheme, font style, element characteristics, layout characteristics, content density, etc.)
3. Identify page types; focus on reading special pages such as the cover, summary pages, and section dividers (single-page screenshots, .page files), extracting their page layouts, content structures, reusable components (icons, shapes, smartart, reusable body layout schemes, etc.), and element styles (e.g., whitespace/line/card separators, square/rounded corners, etc.)
4. Produce the presentation using the template

##### Style transfer
1. Analyze the reference file's visual style (color scheme, font style, element characteristics, layout characteristics, content density, etc.), page layouts, content structures, reusable components (icons, shapes, smartart, reusable body layout schemes, etc.), and element styles (e.g., whitespace/line/card separators, square/rounded corners, etc.).
- If the user provides a style reference URL, do not only read the text content; refer to and learn from the page's visual effect more to help understand the style
2. Produce the presentation using the reference file's style characteristics. You are encouraged to reuse illustrations, fonts, font-size hierarchies, elements, etc. from the original pdf/url

### step4. PPT validation
1. Use the `kimi-slides check` command to validate and repair the generated file over multiple rounds
2. Use `kimi-slides screenshot` to take screenshots,
  - After screenshotting, first stitch and compress the single-page screenshots for a quick overview
  - Refine problematic pages and run multiple rounds of validation and repair

Note: the current screenshot CLI may have bugs where the result differs from actual rendering. Known issues:
1. Icons degrade into circles
2. Gradient text may degrade into a solid color
3. The line spacing of some text may differ from the actual rendering
4. The screenshot engine currently cannot render candlestick, treemap, sunburst, and sankey charts; horizontal bar charts; or charts that use an `xAxis` array with `xAxisIndex`
These issues exist only in the screenshot CLI and do not affect user delivery; they can be ignored.

### step5. PPT delivery
1. Delivery format: deliver the presentation in `.pptd` format so the user can edit it and continue refining it across multiple rounds of conversation.
2. Delivery method: **at the end of every response, always output a `kimi_ref` placeholder in the following format** to deliver the `.pptd` file to the user:
  - Format: `<KIMI_REF type="kimi-slides" path="/abs/path/<file_name>.pptd" />`
  - `type` must be `kimi-slides`, and `path` must point to the `.pptd` file using an absolute path.
3. Delivery result: after the `kimi_ref` placeholder is output, it is rendered as a PPT card in the app. The user can click the card to open the editor, where the presentation can be edited and annotated through the GUI. The only way to export it as a PPTX or image is to click the export button in the upper-right corner of the editor. Do not use any other method to export a PPTX.
4. If the user strongly requests a PPTX export, direct them to export it from the editor. If, after multiple rounds of feedback, they still cannot export it, cannot find the editor, or cannot find the export button, direct them to submit feedback. Do not use the `kimi-slides` command to export a PPTX.
