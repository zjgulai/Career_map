# E-commerce Marketing Orchestrator

Route marketing requests to 19 sub-skills across 5 capabilities. Adapt to whatever skills the user has installed — do what you can now, then tell them what else they could install.

## Step 1: Check Environment

**Before anything else**, run the environment check to know what's available:

```bash
# Read these two paths from your system prompt:
#   - Account skills dir: the directory containing account-level installed skills
#     (appears in available_skills table paths as ~/.accio/accounts/{accountId}/skills/{name})
#   - Agent skills dir: the AGENT_SKILL_DIR value from your system prompt
# Pass them as positional arguments:
bash scripts/check_environment.sh <account_skills_dir> [agent_skills_dir]
```

Parse the JSON output into three lists:
- **installed**: skills you can activate immediately
- **missing**: skills you cannot use — collect these for the install suggestion at the end
- **apis**: which APIs are configured

**Keep the missing list in memory throughout the conversation.** You will need it at the end.

## Step 2: Gather Context

Ask the user these questions (skip any already answered):

1. **Product/service**: What are you selling? (URL or description)
2. **Goal**: What's the marketing objective? (launch, grow sales, brand awareness, etc.)
3. **Stage**: New product or existing? Any current marketing?
4. **Market**: Global or China-specific?
5. **Constraints**: Budget, timeline, team size?

## Step 3: Route & Execute with Available Skills

Map user intent to capabilities, then **only activate installed skills**:

| User Intent | Capability | Skills (check installed) |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Market research / competitors | **Research** | `company-research`, `competitive-landscape`, `people-research` |
| Campaign strategy / launch plan | **Strategy** | `product-marketing-context` → `launch-strategy`, `marketing-ideas`, `content-strategy` |
| Write copy / product descriptions | **Content** | `copywriting`, `product-description-generator`, `social-content`, `instagram-marketing`, `remotion` |
| Post to social media | **Publishing** | `mcp-tools`, `social-media-publisher`, xiaohongshu-explore |
| Conversion / analytics | **Optimization** | `page-cro`, `ab-test-setup` |

Supporting skills: `marketing-psychology`, `review-summarizer`, `social-network-mapper`, `sales-negotiator`

### Execution rules:

1. **Use only installed skills.** For each step in the workflow, check if the skill is installed. If yes, activate it. If not, skip it and note it as a gap.
2. **Do as much as possible.** Even if only 2 out of 7 workflow skills are installed, run those 2 and deliver partial but real value.
3. **Adapt the workflow.** When a skill is missing, explain what that step would have done, then move to the next installed skill.
4. **Suggest max 2-3 skills per turn.** Explain WHY each is needed.
5. **For detailed workflows**, read `references/workflows.md`. For sub-skill I/O specs, read `references/skill-interfaces.md`.

### Workflow patterns (adapt based on what's installed):

**Product launch** (ideal 6-step):
```
product-marketing-context → company-research → launch-strategy
→ product-description-generator → copywriting → social-content
```

**Quick content creation**:
```
product-marketing-context → copywriting / social-content / instagram-marketing
```

**Conversion diagnosis**:
```
page-cro → ab-test-setup → copywriting (apply quick wins)
```

## Step 4: Deliver Results + Install Suggestions

After completing all available workflow steps, **always end with an install recommendation section**.

### Format:

```
## What I did

[Summary of completed steps and deliverables]

## What else you could do

The following skills would unlock additional capabilities for your goal:

| Skill to Install | What It Adds | Priority |
|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| `copywriting` | Marketing copy for landing pages, ads, emails, CTAs | High |
| `product-description-generator` | SEO-optimized product descriptions for Shopify/Amazon/Etsy | High |
| ... | ... | ... |

To install a skill, ask me: "install the [skill-name] skill"
```

### Priority assignment logic:

- **High**: Directly needed for the user's stated goal and has no workaround
- **Medium**: Would improve quality or add a useful secondary capability
- **Low**: Nice to have, not critical for current goal

### API configuration suggestions (only if relevant):

If installed skills need APIs that aren't configured, also mention:

```
## API Setup Needed

Some installed skills need API keys to work fully:

| Skill | API Needed | How to Get It |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| `company-research` | Exa API | Set EXA_API_KEY env var (get key at exa.ai/api) |
| ... | ... | ... |
```

## Behavioral Rules

1. **Do first, suggest later** — always execute available skills before talking about missing ones
2. **Never block on missing skills** — partial results are better than no results
3. **Be specific about gaps** — don't just say "install more skills", name each one and explain what it adds for THIS user's goal
4. **Adapt to level** — beginners get starter packs, advanced users get optimization tactics
5. **End with measurement** — every workflow should include an analytics step (or note that it's missing)
6. **Don't read unrelated skills** — only read SKILL.md files for skills you are about to activate

## Bundled Resources

| Resource | When to Read |
|----------|-------------|
| `references/workflows.md` | User needs a multi-step campaign or end-to-end launch plan |
| `references/skill-interfaces.md` | Need to check what inputs a sub-skill requires or what it outputs |
| `scripts/check_environment.sh` | **Always run first** before any other step |
