# Analyze Customer Behavior and RFM Segments

## Overview

Customer analytics transforms raw order data into actionable insights about purchase patterns, lifecycle stages, and churn risk. By segmenting customers based on their actual behavior rather than demographics, merchants can deploy targeted interventions that increase Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

The core of this analysis relies on three frameworks:
1.  **RFM Scoring**: Ranking customers by Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.
2.  **Cohort Retention**: Tracking how groups of customers acquired at the same time behave over their first 12 months.
3.  **Purchase Frequency**: Measuring the "stickiness" of the product and the speed of the second-purchase conversion.

## When to Use This Skill

- When your acquisition costs (CAC) are rising and you need to maximize the value of existing customers.
- When you need to identify "VIP" or "Champion" customers for loyalty programs or early-access launches.
- When the business needs to predict future revenue based on historical cohort performance.
- When you need to identify acquisition channels (Google, Meta, Organic) that produce the highest-quality long-term buyers.

## The RFM Framework

RFM is the industry standard for behavioral segmentation. Assign a score (typically 1-5) to each customer for each category:

- **Recency (R)**: Days since the last order. Recent buyers are the most likely to buy again.
- **Frequency (F)**: Total number of orders. High frequency indicates brand loyalty.
- **Monetary (M)**: Total lifetime spend. High monetary value identifies your "whales" or VIPs.

### Segment Definitions and Actions

| Segment | RFM Profile | Strategic Objective | Recommended Action |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **Champions** | High R, High F, High M | Reward & Retain | Invite to VIP program; early access to new products; request reviews. |
| **Loyal Customers** | Med-High R, High F | Upsell | Cross-sell higher-margin items; offer subscription options. |
| **At Risk** | Low R, Med F | Re-engage | Multi-step win-back sequence: reminder → small incentive → final "we miss you" offer. |
| **One-Time Buyers** | High R, Low F | Convert to Repeat | "Next-best-product" recommendation based on their first purchase. |
| **About to Sleep** | Low R, Low F | Reactivate | aggressive discount or low-cost re-engagement attempt. |

## Platform-Agnostic Segmentation Logic

In your ecommerce platform's customer admin or your email marketing tool, create segments using these logical filters:

- **VIP Segment**: `Total Spent > [2x Average Order Value] AND Total Orders >= 3`
- **At-Risk Segment**: `Last Order Date > 90 Days Ago AND Last Order Date < 180 Days Ago AND Total Orders >= 2`
- **New High-Value Segment**: `First Order Date < 30 Days Ago AND Total Spent > [1.5x Average Order Value]`
- **Churned Segment**: `Last Order Date > 180 Days Ago` (Consider suppressing these from paid ads to save costs).

## Retention Benchmarks

Measure your performance against these industry standards for DTC and B2B ecommerce:

### 1. Purchase Frequency Distribution
- **One-time buyers**: 60–70% (Typical). If higher, your onboarding or product quality may be failing.
- **Repeat buyers (2+ orders)**: 30–40% (Healthy).
- **Power users (5+ orders)**: 5–10% (Excellent).

### 2. Cohort Retention Targets
A cohort retention grid shows what percentage of customers acquired in a specific month are still active in subsequent months.

| Months After First Order | Minimum Viable | Healthy | Excellent |
|--------------------------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| **Month 1** (Second purchase) | 15% | 25% | 40%+ |
| **Month 3** | 10% | 20% | 35%+ |
| **Month 12** | 5% | 15% | 30%+ |

## Deepening the Analysis

### 1. CLV by Acquisition Channel
Total LTV is a vanity metric; you must calculate it by channel to inform budget allocation.
- **Method**: Segment your customers by their *first* order source (UTM source).
- **Formula**: `(Total Revenue from Channel Cohort) / (Total Number of Customers in Channel Cohort)`
- **Nuance**: You may find that Meta ads have a higher CAC but produce 3x the 12-month LTV compared to Google Search. This justifies higher front-end spending on Meta.

### 2. Multi-Touch Attribution Nuance
When calculating CLV, use **First-Touch Attribution** to understand which channel actually "built" the customer relationship. Using Last-Touch will over-attribute value to "Direct" or "Email," masking the effectiveness of your top-of-funnel discovery channels.

### 3. Handling Seasonal Buyers
Standard churn logic (e.g., "haven't bought in 90 days") fails for seasonal businesses.
- **The Seasonal Flag**: If a customer only buys in November/December for two consecutive years, flag them as "Seasonal."
- **Strategy**: Do not send them win-back emails in July. Instead, move them to a "Seasonal Reactivation" list that only triggers 30 days before their expected annual purchase window.

### 4. Discount Guard Logic
Before sending an incentive to an "At-Risk" customer, check their historical discount usage.
- If a customer has **never** used a discount, send a "brand-led" re-engagement email first (new arrivals, content).
- If a customer **always** uses a discount, they are likely "discount-sensitive." Only a coupon will bring them back. This preserves your margins on full-price loyalists.

## Operational Checklist

- [ ] **Monthly RFM Update**: Refresh scores every 30 days.
- [ ] **Second-Purchase Window**: Identify the average days between order 1 and order 2. Set your first automated retention trigger 5 days *before* this window ends.
- [ ] **Data Hygiene**: Ensure "Test" orders and "Canceled" orders are excluded from your LTV and frequency calculations.
- [ ] **Cohort Baseline**: Establish a 12-month retention baseline before launching a new loyalty program to measure its true impact.
