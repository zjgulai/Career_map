description: Use when a LoopX-managed goal runs, tracks, scores, or analyzes a benchmark experiment through benchmark-toolkit, including experiment-board rows, solver arms, integrity qualification, matched comparisons, or case insights. Do not use for casual benchmark discussion, ordinary software microbenchmarks, or eval mentions without LoopX experiment state.

# LoopX Benchmark Workflow

Use this skill for a LoopX-managed benchmark experiment. The builtin
`benchmark-toolkit` capability owns provider-neutral experiment state and
integrity boundaries. This packaged skill is its task-triggered Agent playbook.

The capability is catalog-ready without a per-Goal enable switch. Installing
this skill does not grant runner, shell, network, credential, private-evidence,
or Goal mutation authority. Respect the selected todo's required capabilities,
any external provider binding, host permissions, and user gates.

## Capability surface

- `loopx capability show benchmark-toolkit --format json` — catalog entry with
  usage hints, role boundaries, and the post-run case-insight template.
- `loopx benchmark --help` — subcommands (experiment-board-show,
  experiment-board-upsert, source-revision-fence, integrity-qualification,
  classify-artifacts).

## Share a study through the public-safe contract

When another benchmark developer needs portable study data, use the capability's
typed study flow rather than sharing a runner-specific ledger or raw evidence:

1. Validate `benchmark_study_manifest_v0` with `benchmark study-validate`.
2. Wrap one allowlisted manifest, experiment-board row, redacted insight, or runtime
   observation with `benchmark upload-envelope`.
3. Run `benchmark upload-local` without `--execute` first, then explicitly execute
   against a caller-selected local JSONL store.
4. Verify the record/digest/revision binding with `benchmark upload-readback`.
5. Derive the campaign/arm/case/run packet with `benchmark study-dashboard`; pass a
   compact four-arm contract only when the study preregistered that design.

The local provider is a no-network simulation. It does not grant remote upload,
publication, credentials, retention, or benchmark submission authority. Adapters
keep their native metric names and reduce private post-run evidence before envelope
construction.

## Select the operating lane

- **Inspect or explain:** use `capability show` and `benchmark --help`; remain
  read-only. Do not create an experiment-board row merely because the user asks
  what the toolkit does.
- **Plan, select, or launch a run:** follow the experiment sequence below. The
  first action is to read the board; a launch still requires an authorized
  runner and admitted source.
- **Monitor an active campaign:** read the board and runtime-owned projections;
  update only on material run transitions. Do not manufacture progress from a
  timer tick.
- **Analyze a terminal run:** wait until solving is terminal and scoring is
  complete before reading hidden evaluator evidence or writing a case insight.

For a generic library microbenchmark or an eval with no LoopX Goal/board, use
the task's normal tools instead of imposing this workflow.

## Experiment sequence

1. **Read the experiment board before launching or selecting a case.**
   ```bash
   loopx benchmark experiment-board-show --goal-id <GOAL_ID> --format json
   ```
   Inspect baseline, treatment, explore, countability, effort, and insight rows
   before choosing the next arm.

2. **Qualify the source revision before each new run admission.**
   ```bash
   loopx benchmark source-revision-fence \
     --source-checkout <clean-source> \
     --expected-revision <PIN> \
     --observed-reference-revision <OBSERVED_HEAD> \
     --require-admitted --format json
   ```
   The fence fails closed unless the clean pinned source matches the observed
   reference head.

3. **Preview, then preregister or mark the run row when it starts.**
   ```bash
   loopx benchmark experiment-board-upsert --goal-id <GOAL_ID> \
     --row-json <running-row.json> --format json
   loopx benchmark experiment-board-upsert --goal-id <GOAL_ID> \
     --row-json <running-row.json> --execute --format json
   ```
   The running row uses `status=running`, empty `metrics`, and
   `countability={integrity_qualified:false, official_result_present:false,
   score_countable:false}`. Keep the same stable `run_id` for every transition.

4. **Preview and upsert terminal score, countability, effort, and insight.**
   First run integrity qualification. An automated restricted-access match is a
   countable suspicion, not a cheating verdict. After solver and scoring are
   terminal, inspect the real solver trajectory, tool results, and final
   workspace. Pass a compact
   `benchmark_restricted_access_adjudication_v0` only after that review; confirm
   cheating only when restricted material was actually disclosed and causally
   entered a solving or validation decision.

   ```bash
   loopx benchmark experiment-board-upsert --goal-id <GOAL_ID> \
     --row-json <terminal-row.json> --execute --format json
   ```
   The terminal row sets `status=completed`, fills `metrics` (primary metric plus
   guardrails), and updates `countability`. Only mark `score_countable=true` when
   `integrity_qualified=true` and `official_result_present=true`. Fill `effort`
   and set `insight.status` to `complete` after the post-run analysis.

   For non-baseline arms, also reduce the reviewed mechanism facts separately:
   ```bash
   loopx benchmark treatment-continuation-receipt \
     --observation-json <compact-post-run-observation.json> --format json
   ```
   This receipt distinguishes qualified startup from post-start semantic control
   persistence. It is analysis-only and must not change score countability,
   integrity qualification, treatment fidelity, or matched-pair eligibility.

5. **Read matched comparisons before selecting the next arm.**
   ```bash
   loopx benchmark experiment-board-show --goal-id <GOAL_ID> --format json
   ```
   Only claim paired results from `matched_pair_countable` comparisons. Keep
   diagnostic-only explore rows in a separate evidence lane.

## Run-row contract

- `benchmark_id`, `study_id`, `case_id`, `run_id`, `arm_id`, `arm_role`,
  `attempt`, `status`, `observed_at`, `model_id`, `protocol_id`,
  `comparison_protocol_id`, `claim_scope`, `primary_metric`,
  `guardrail_metrics`, `metrics`, `countability`, `treatment_fidelity`,
  `effort`, `insight` are the canonical row fields (`schema_version` =
  `benchmark_experiment_board_row_v0`).
- Baseline rows must use `treatment_fidelity=not_applicable` and cannot name a
  `comparison_anchor_run_id`. Non-baseline rows must name a
  `comparison_anchor_run_id`.
- Metrics are `{"name": {"value": <number>, "unit": <str>,
  "higher_is_better": <bool>}}`; at most 16 entries. The `primary_metric` must
  not also be a guardrail metric.
- `score_countable` requires `status=completed`, `integrity_qualified=true`,
  and `official_result_present=true`. `score=0` is a valid completed result.

## Source, integrity, and artifact boundaries

- `source-revision-fence` is read-only and caller-observed: it performs no
  fetch, install, or launch. It blocks new admissions only.
- `integrity-qualification` reduces private trajectory and runner isolation
  evidence to a compact public-safe receipt (hashes, counts, reason codes).
- Scanner hits for restricted source access or host-boundary escape probes set
  `restricted_access_review=suspected` while keeping the run score-eligible. Use
  `--restricted-access-adjudication-json` for the post-run agent decision; only
  confirmed disclosure plus causal use disqualifies the score.
- `classify-artifacts` classifies benchmark artifact paths without reading them;
  use it before reading or publishing any candidate artifact.
- The solver lane must not read hidden tests, verifier sources, gold answers, or
  official feedback during the solving phase. The post-run analyst may read full
  private evidence only after the solver is terminal and scoring is complete.
- `capability bind` selects an external provider implementation for a Goal; it
  is not the activation mechanism for this builtin capability. Todo
  `required_capability` fields remain runtime prerequisites, not product
  capability switches.

## Campaign monitoring and post-run insight

- When a campaign starts and the caller authorizes ongoing monitoring, add one
  `continuous_monitor` todo. Refresh aggregate score/coverage and write
  `benchmark_case_insight_v0` on material scored-case transitions, with bounded
  periodic reviews while the campaign remains active.
- Treat that monitor as an observation lane, not executable delivery. When a
  material poll discovers bounded repository, runner-repair, or experiment work,
  use `quota monitor-poll --material-change --next-agent-todo` with explicit
  `--next-action-kind`, repository, and required capabilities so it creates an
  independent runnable `advancement_task`. An unchanged poll creates no successor
  and spends no delivery quota.
- If the main campaign advancement Todo is waiting for a monitor transition, keep
  it `open` and pair `resume_when=monitor_changed:<monitor-todo-id>` with an
  already-created independent runnable successor. Do not mark the wait `blocked`,
  and do not treat the monitor itself as delivery work.
- Report only public-safe conclusions (countable baselines, countable
  treatments, matched pairs, aggregate primary metric by arm, improved/flat/
  regressed pair counts). Never copy raw private evidence into a user update.
- After a solver stops and scoring completes, read the task, real trajectory,
  final workspace, hidden tests, verifier, and failure/score details; write one
  `benchmark_case_insight_v0` explaining the decisive evidence, why the outcome
  happened, and what LoopX should test next.
- For treatment arms, record whether qualified startup was followed by semantic
  Todo transitions, technical replans, or control closeout. Use `startup_only`
  only when a complete authorized post-run review observed no such transition;
  otherwise absence is `unknown`. Keep terminal settlement separate.
- Do not send a repetitive user update when nothing material changed.
