# People Research

## Tool Selection (Critical)

Exa search is available via **MCP tools** — no API key needed. Use **`accio-mcp-cli`** to invoke them (see **mcp-tools** / **accio-mcp-cli** skills). To discover or verify tool names, run `accio-mcp-cli search exa` (or `accio-mcp-cli toolkit`) before `call`.

**Preferred tools (in order):**

1. **`exa_web_search_exa`** (via `accio-mcp-cli call`) — supports `category`, `livecrawl`, `type`, `numResults`. Best for people discovery with `category: "people"`.
2. **`web_search_exa`** (via `accio-mcp-cli call`) — supports `num_results`, `include_domains`, `exclude_domains`, `start_published_date`, `end_published_date`, `include_text`, `type`. Best for filtered/domain-scoped searches.
3. **`get_page_contents_exa`** — extract text/summary from profile URLs.
4. **`exa_answer`** — get a direct answer with source citations.

**Fallback:** If Exa tools are unavailable (e.g. connection error, tool not found), ask the user to provide an `EXA_API_KEY` environment variable and use the Exa REST API directly via `bash`/`curl`.

### Calling Convention

All Exa MCP tools are invoked with `accio-mcp-cli call`. Prefer `--json` for nested or camelCase parameters:

```bash
accio-mcp-cli call exa_web_search_exa \
  --json '{"query":"...","numResults":20,"type":"auto","category":"people"}'
```

## Token Isolation (Critical)

Never run Exa searches in main context. Always spawn Task agents:
- Agent runs Exa search internally
- Agent processes results using LLM intelligence
- Agent returns only distilled output (compact JSON or brief markdown)
- Main context stays clean regardless of search volume

## Dynamic Tuning

No hardcoded numResults. Tune to user intent:
- User says "a few" → 10-20
- User says "comprehensive" → 50-100
- User specifies number → match it
- Ambiguous? Ask: "How many profiles would you like?"

## Query Variation

Exa returns different results for different phrasings. For coverage:
- Generate 2-3 query variations
- Run in parallel
- Merge and deduplicate

## Categories

Use appropriate Exa `category` (via `exa_web_search_exa`) depending on what you need:
- `people` → LinkedIn profiles, public bios (primary for discovery)
- `personal site` → personal blogs, portfolio sites, about pages
- `news` → press mentions, interviews, speaker bios
- No category (`type: "auto"`) → general web results, broader context

Start with `category: "people"` for profile discovery, then use other categories or no category with `livecrawl: "fallback"` for deeper research on specific individuals.

### Category-Specific Filter Restrictions

When using `category: "people"`, these parameters cause errors:
- `startPublishedDate` / `endPublishedDate`
- `startCrawlDate` / `endCrawlDate`
- `includeText` / `excludeText`
- `excludeDomains`
- `includeDomains` — **LinkedIn domains only** (e.g., "linkedin.com")

When searching without a category, all parameters are available (but `includeText`/`excludeText` still only support single-item arrays).

## LinkedIn

Public LinkedIn via Exa: `category: "people"`, no other filters.
Auth-required LinkedIn → use browser automation fallback.

## Browser Fallback

Auto-fallback to browser automation when:
- Exa returns insufficient results
- Content is auth-gated
- Dynamic pages need JavaScript

## Examples

### Discovery: find people by role
```bash
accio-mcp-cli call exa_web_search_exa \
  --json '{"query":"VP Engineering AI infrastructure","category":"people","numResults":20,"type":"auto"}'
```

### Deep dive: research a specific person
```bash
accio-mcp-cli call web_search_exa \
  --json '{"query":"Dario Amodei Anthropic CEO background","type":"auto","num_results":15}'
```

### News mentions
```bash
accio-mcp-cli call web_search_exa \
  --json '{"query":"Dario Amodei interview","num_results":10,"start_published_date":"2024-01-01"}'
```

### Extract profile content
```bash
accio-mcp-cli call get_page_contents_exa \
  --json '{"urls":["https://linkedin.com/in/example"],"text":true,"summary":true}'
```

### Direct answer about a person
```bash
accio-mcp-cli call exa_answer \
  --json '{"query":"Who is Dario Amodei and what is his background?","text":true}'
```

## Output Format

Return:
1) Results (name, title, company, location if available)
2) Sources (Profile URLs)
3) Notes (profile completeness, verification status)
