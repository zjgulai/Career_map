description: Diagnose and repair LoopX control-plane drift or agent behavior drift. Use when a LoopX task makes unexpectedly small progress, follows a stale or contradictory recommended_action, ignores a higher-priority blocked item while doing fallback work, reports vague owner/user gates, loses todo projection, misaligns benchmark treatment with the real product path, mixes temporary artifacts into commits, or when the user asks for root-cause analysis, self-repair, or why the harness/agent behaved unexpectedly.

# LoopX Self Repair

Use this skill to turn a surprising LoopX behavior into a durable fix,
not only an apology or a one-off explanation.

## Repair Loop

1. **Pause delivery selection.** Do not spend quota or continue adapter work
   until the control-plane facts explain why that work is valid.
2. **Build a compact evidence packet.** Prefer structured surfaces:

   ```bash
   git status --short --branch
   loopx --format json diagnose --goal-id <goal-id>
   loopx --format json status --goal-id <goal-id> --limit 20
   loopx --format json quota should-run --goal-id <goal-id> [--agent-id <agent-id>]
   loopx --format json history --goal-id <goal-id> --limit 5
   ```

   `status` defaults to the registry/dashboard view, but accepts `--goal-id`
   when the repair needs one goal-focused projection. Use
   `diagnose --goal-id` for the richer goal-specific agent reasoning packet.
   Also inspect the project-local registry and the registry-declared active
   state file when relevant. Use the shared global registry for heartbeat/quota
   truth.
3. **Classify the failure.** Read
   `references/repair-patterns.md` and match the symptoms to a known pattern.
   If no pattern fits, add one after the fix.
4. **Assign the responsible layer.** Separate:
   - agent behavior mistake;
   - state projection or quota payload bug;
   - active-state authoring gap;
   - benchmark harness mismatch;
   - docs/process hygiene gap.
5. **Repair at the lowest durable layer.**
   - If it is a one-off agent mistake, write back the correct state/todo and
     continue with a larger bounded batch.
   - If the machine projection misled the agent, fix CLI/status/quota
     projection and add a focused smoke.
   - If the user correction changes the goal acceptance, says the agent missed
     the intended loop, or exposes a product bottleneck that is not visible in
     quota/status, write a bounded `goal_vision_replan_contract_v0` packet with
     `replan_trigger_summary` through normal `loopx refresh-state --vision-*`
     fields, using the same `--agent-id` as the current lane, or
     `--agent-vision-json` for generated multi-field patches, before returning
     to delivery. If the next executable step is already known, also add or
     link the concrete successor todo; do not leave the correction only in chat
     or an incident note.
   - If a design rule is missing, update the interaction model or todo list
     before implementing broad behavior.
   - If benchmark evidence is not attributable, add posthoc trace/parity
     checks before claiming uplift or regression.
6. **Validate before resuming.** Run the smallest smoke or CLI check that would
   have caught the issue, plus `loopx check` on changed public surfaces
   when docs/contracts changed.
7. **Write back the lesson.** Update active goal state, docs, contributor
   tasks, or this skill so the same failure mode is visible next time.

## Upstream Issue Escalation

A public GitHub issue is an optional final escalation, not a default side
effect of self-repair. Consider it only when the responsible layer is a
reusable LoopX product, CLI, skill, installer, or control-plane gap and durable
upstream tracking adds value beyond the local repair or PR.

Read `references/upstream-issue-escalation.md` before publishing anything.
Invoking this skill never grants publication permission. The guarded path must:

1. reject private, project-specific, support-only, and security-sensitive
   reports;
2. reduce the evidence to a minimal public-safe reproduction and scan the
   draft with `loopx check`;
3. search open and closed issues by a stable fingerprint before creating one;
4. auto-submit only under explicit current-turn approval or durable owner
   opt-in; otherwise show the exact draft and ask once for confirmation;
5. create at most one issue per repair turn, then record the existing or new
   issue URL in the relevant LoopX todo/evidence writeback.

If qualification, authority, authentication, boundary scanning, or duplicate
search is uncertain, preserve the draft and stop before publication. Prefer a
direct fix or PR when no separate issue is needed for coordination.

## Vision / Replan Writeback

Use the bounded vision contract when self-repair discovers that LoopX did not
notice a missing outcome, route, or acceptance condition by itself. The packet is
the bridge from human or agent insight to quota-visible replan state:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "goal_vision_replan_contract_v0",
  "state": "vision_drift_detected",
  "vision_patch": {
    "vision_summary": "Name the corrected route or acceptance target.",
    "acceptance_summary": "Name the machine-visible condition that must hold.",
    "replan_trigger_summary": "Name why the current frontier is insufficient."
  },
  "todo_delta": ["create_successor"]
}
```

Record it with normal inline `refresh-state --vision-summary
--vision-acceptance --vision-replan-trigger` fields using the same `--agent-id`
that ran the repair. Use `--agent-vision-json` when a generated patch is clearer
than a command line. Replan closes only through a typed semantic observation or
an atomic Todo transition bound with `--replan-obligation-id`, a typed
`--action-kind`, and a stable `--target-key` or Explore node ref; do not append
a second `--autonomous-replan-recorded` repair ACK. A vision patch without a
runnable Todo is still useful: `quota should-run` can promote its
`replan_trigger_summary` into `goal_frontier_projection.acceptance_gaps[]` when
the advancement frontier is empty.

If the repair concludes that the existing per-agent vision is still correct,
close the required checkpoint with `--vision-unchanged-reason` instead of
writing a fake patch. If a material `refresh-state` lacks both a patch and an
unchanged/no-follow-up decision, LoopX should preserve a per-agent
`vision_checkpoint_v0` with `decision=missing_required` so the same agent's
next quota check can enter replan. A scheduler wake alone is not a material
vision boundary: when quota explicitly projects a normally admitted open
advancement Todo as `delivery_boundary=in_flight_continuation`, use the
projected settlement command and do not invent a vision patch. The next
heartbeat keeps that same Todo selected only after accountable
`outcome_progress`; Todo completion, blocker/gap, durable Next Action change,
replan, or terminal closeout must return to the strict semantic checkpoint.

## Evidence Discipline

- Do not read or commit raw private logs, trajectories, verifier output,
  credentials, internal links, or production material.
- Do not solve contradictory payloads by guessing. If `recommended_action`,
  `goal_boundary.write_scope`, todos, and interaction contract disagree, treat
  that as a projection bug or state authoring bug first.
- Do not let fallback work hide the primary blocker. When a higher-priority
  path is gated but safe fallback is valid, report both the concrete gate and
  the fallback progress.
- Do not let tiny safe steps become the default. If several recent turns are
  short or surface-only, run a steering audit and increase the next bounded
  batch size unless a real gate blocks it.
