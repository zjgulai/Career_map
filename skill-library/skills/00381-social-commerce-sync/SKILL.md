# Social Commerce Sync

## Overview

Social commerce transforms social media platforms from discovery engines into high-conversion sales channels. By synchronizing your ecommerce catalog with Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and TikTok, you enable "Shoppable" content where customers can purchase products directly from posts, reels, or live streams. This skill focuses on the technical architecture of catalog feeds, real-time sync via APIs, and the management of "In-App" vs. "Storefront" checkout models.

## The Social Commerce Landscape

| Platform | Model | Best For | Checkout Strategy |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Instagram/FB** | Catalog-Driven | Lifestyle, Fashion | In-App (US) / Redirect (Global) |
| **TikTok Shop** | Creator-Driven | Viral, Impulse, Beauty | In-App Native |
| **Pinterest** | Discovery-Driven | Home, DIY, Decor | Redirect to Store |

### Decision Criteria: In-App Checkout vs. Storefront Redirect
- **In-App Checkout:** Maximizes conversion by reducing friction. However, you lose direct customer data (email/pixel) and pay higher platform fees (e.g., TikTok's ~5%).
- **Storefront Redirect:** Better for brand building and capturing first-party data. Conversion rates are typically 10-20% lower than in-app native checkout.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Catalog Feed Architecture

A high-quality feed is the foundation of social commerce. Missing attributes (e.g., `google_product_category`) will lead to rejected items.

#### Technical Implementation (Generic XML Feed)
```typescript
import { XMLBuilder } from 'fast-xml-parser';

// Generate a Meta/Google compatible RSS feed
export async function generateCatalogFeed(products: any[]) {
  const items = products.map(p => ({
    'g:id': p.sku,
    'g:title': p.name,
    'g:description': p.description,
    'g:link': `${process.env.STORE_URL}/products/${p.handle}`,
    'g:image_link': p.featured_image,
    'g:availability': p.inventory > 0 ? 'in stock' : 'out of stock',
    'g:price': `${p.price} USD`,
    'g:brand': 'YourBrand',
    'g:condition': 'new',
    'g:item_group_id': p.parent_id // Crucial for variant grouping
  }));

  const builder = new XMLBuilder({ arrayNodeName: 'item' });
  return builder.build({ rss: { channel: { item: items } } });
}
```

### Step 2: Native Platform Configuration

#### Shopify Admin
1.  Navigate to **Sales Channels**. Add "Facebook & Instagram" or "TikTok."
2.  **Account Linking:** Connect your Meta Business Manager or TikTok Seller Center.
3.  **Sync Logic:** Ensure "Inventory Sync" is enabled. Shopify will automatically push `inventory_quantity` updates to social channels.

#### WooCommerce Admin
1.  Use the native **Marketing > Facebook** or **TikTok** settings.
2.  **Product Sync:** Map your WooCommerce categories to "Google Product Categories" (GPC). Incorrect GPC mapping is the #1 cause of catalog rejection.

### Step 3: Real-Time API Synchronization (Edge Cases)

For high-velocity stores, waiting for an hourly XML crawl is too slow and leads to "Inventory Overselling." Use the **Batch API** for instant updates.

```typescript
// Example: Meta Catalog Batch Update
async function updateMetaInventory(sku: string, newQty: number) {
  const status = newQty > 0 ? 'in stock' : 'out of stock';
  await fetch(`https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/${CATALOG_ID}/items_batch`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      requests: [{
        method: 'UPDATE',
        retailer_id: sku,
        data: { availability: status }
      }]
    })
  });
}
```

### Step 4: Catalog Diagnostics & Health

- **Image Compliance:** Images with promotional text ("SALE!", "50% OFF") or heavy watermarks are frequently rejected by Meta. Use clean, high-resolution product photography on a neutral background.
- **Variant Grouping:** Ensure `item_group_id` is consistent across all sizes/colors of a product. If missing, each size will appear as a separate, duplicate product in the social shop.
- **Price Consistency:** The price in the feed **must** match the price on the landing page. If you use dynamic pricing or currency conversion, ensure the "Open Graph" (OG) tags on your site match the feed data.

## Benchmarks & Performance Targets

| Metric | Target (Good) | Target (Elite) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Catalog Approval Rate** | > 90% | > 99% |
| **Social Shop CR (In-App)** | 3% - 5% | > 8% |
| **Social vs. Web Revenue** | 5% of Total | > 15% of Total |
| **Inventory Latency** | < 1 Hour | < 5 Minutes |

## Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

- **The "Ghost" Product:** An item is "Approved" in the catalog but doesn't show in the Instagram Shop. **Solution:** Check "Visible to Instagram" settings in Meta Commerce Manager under the "Sets" or "Shops" tab.
- **TikTok Seller Review:** TikTok often requires physical proof of business registration or identity before the Shop goes live. Complete this *before* syncing the catalog to avoid "Pending" status for weeks.
- **Checkout Blocked:** If your store's SSL certificate is invalid or your site is password-protected, social platforms will block your checkout redirect.
- **Overselling on Social:** During flash sales, social platforms may lag in inventory sync by 15-30 minutes. **Mitigation:** Set an "Inventory Buffer" in your feed logic—tell the social platform an item is "Out of Stock" when your actual inventory hits 5 units.
