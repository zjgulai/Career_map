# Performance Audit Skill

This skill provides elite performance engineering expertise for making applications lightning-fast through systematic optimization.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- Analyzing slow page loads or response times
- Identifying performance bottlenecks in code execution
- Designing and implementing caching strategies
- Optimizing database queries and preventing N+1 problems
- Reducing memory consumption or investigating memory leaks
- Improving asset delivery (compression, minification, bundling)
- Implementing lazy loading or code splitting
- Profiling and benchmarking code performance
- Reviewing new features for performance implications
- Establishing performance budgets for critical user journeys

## Core Performance Expertise

### 1. Performance Analysis Methodology

To analyze performance issues effectively:

**Measure First**: Always establish baseline metrics before optimization. Use profiling tools, timing measurements, and performance monitoring to identify actual bottlenecks rather than assumed ones.

**Prioritize Impact**: Focus on optimizations that provide the greatest performance improvement relative to implementation effort. Target the critical path and high-traffic code paths first.

**Consider Trade-offs**: Evaluate each optimization for its impact on code maintainability, complexity, and resource usage. Sometimes a 10% performance gain isn't worth a 50% increase in code complexity.

**Validate Improvements**: After implementing optimizations, measure again to confirm actual performance gains. Be prepared to roll back changes that don't deliver meaningful improvements.

### 2. Caching Strategies

To implement effective caching:

- Choose the appropriate caching layer (browser cache, CDN, application cache, database query cache, computed result cache)
- Implement proper cache invalidation strategies to prevent stale data issues
- Use cache keys that are specific enough to avoid collisions but general enough to maximize hit rates
- Set appropriate TTLs based on data volatility and business requirements
- Implement cache warming for predictable high-traffic scenarios
- Use cache-aside, write-through, or write-behind patterns as appropriate
- Monitor cache hit rates and adjust strategies based on real usage patterns

**Key Rules:**
- Never cache without considering invalidation strategy
- Always measure cache hit rates to validate effectiveness
- Balance cache complexity against actual performance benefits

### 3. Frontend Performance Optimization

To optimize frontend performance, focus on:

**Core Web Vitals (primary metrics):**
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Measures loading performance. Target under 2.5 seconds. Optimize by preloading critical resources, using responsive images, and minimizing render-blocking resources
- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: Measures responsiveness. Target under 200ms. Optimize by breaking up long tasks, yielding to the main thread, and minimizing input delay
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Measures visual stability. Target under 0.1. Optimize by setting explicit dimensions on images/embeds, avoiding dynamic content injection above the fold

**Critical Rendering Path:**
- Minimize render-blocking resources (CSS, JavaScript)
- Prioritize above-the-fold content loading
- Use resource hints (preload, prefetch, preconnect)

**Asset Optimization:**
- Compress and minify JavaScript and CSS
- Optimize images (format selection: WebP/AVIF, compression, responsive sizes)
- Implement lazy loading for images and off-screen content
- Use code splitting to reduce initial bundle size
- Analyze bundles for tree-shaking opportunities and dead code elimination
- Use tools like webpack-bundle-analyzer, source-map-explorer, or rollup-plugin-visualizer to identify bloat

**Runtime Performance (framework-aware):**
- Debounce and throttle user interaction handlers
- Use virtual scrolling for large lists
- Offload CPU-intensive tasks to Web Workers
- **React**: Avoid unnecessary re-renders with React.memo, useMemo, useCallback; use React Profiler to identify slow components
- **Vue**: Use computed properties over methods for cached reactivity; leverage v-once for static content; use shallowRef/shallowReactive for large objects
- **Svelte**: Leverage compile-time optimizations; avoid reactive declarations on large objects
- **Angular**: Use OnPush change detection strategy; leverage trackBy in ngFor; use pure pipes for expensive computations

**Key Rules:**
- Always measure with real-world conditions (throttled network, low-end devices)
- Focus on Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) as primary frontend metrics
- Avoid premature optimization of rarely-executed code
- Use Lighthouse, WebPageTest, or Chrome DevTools Performance tab for measurement

### 4. Backend Performance Optimization

To optimize backend performance, address:

**Database Performance:**
- Add indexes on frequently queried columns
- Prevent N+1 query problems with eager loading or batched queries
- Use query explain plans to identify slow operations
- Implement connection pooling for database connections
- Consider read replicas for high-traffic read operations

**Request Processing:**
- Implement pagination and filtering for large datasets
- Use asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- Batch similar operations to reduce overhead
- Implement request/response compression

**Resource Management:**
- Use connection pooling for external services
- Implement circuit breakers for failing dependencies
- Set appropriate timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion

**Streaming and SSR Performance:**
- Use streaming SSR (React Server Components, Nuxt, SvelteKit) to reduce Time to First Byte
- Implement progressive rendering to show content incrementally
- Use edge rendering (middleware, edge functions) for latency-sensitive responses
- Optimize hydration cost by minimizing client-side JavaScript shipped with SSR pages

**GraphQL Performance:**
- Prevent over-fetching by analyzing query complexity and depth
- Implement query depth limiting and cost analysis
- Use DataLoader pattern to batch and deduplicate database requests within a single query
- Implement persisted queries for production to reduce payload size and prevent arbitrary queries

**Key Rules:**
- Database queries should use indexes, not full table scans
- Long-running operations belong in background jobs, not HTTP requests
- Always implement pagination for unbounded result sets

### 5. Concurrency and Thread Safety

To identify and resolve concurrency issues:

- **Race conditions**: Look for shared mutable state accessed from multiple threads/requests without synchronization
- **Deadlocks**: Identify lock ordering violations and resource contention patterns
- **Connection pool exhaustion**: Detect leaked connections, missing disposal, or insufficient pool sizing
- **Event loop blocking (Node.js)**: Identify synchronous operations, CPU-intensive computation, or large JSON parsing on the main thread
- **Worker thread saturation**: Detect thread pool starvation from blocking I/O or long-running synchronous tasks

**Key Rules:**
- Shared mutable state without synchronization is a critical finding
- Connection pool exhaustion causes cascading failures; always verify disposal patterns
- In Node.js, any synchronous operation over ~50ms blocks the event loop and degrades all concurrent requests

### 6. Memory Performance

To optimize memory usage across platforms:

**General patterns:**
- Identify unbounded data structures (caches without eviction, growing arrays, accumulating event listeners)
- Look for large object allocations that pressure garbage collection
- Detect resource leaks (unclosed streams, connections, file handles)

**JavaScript/Node.js specific:**
- Closures capturing large objects unnecessarily
- Uncleared intervals, timeouts, and event listeners
- Global variable accumulation
- Detached DOM nodes in browser environments
- Buffer/stream handling without backpressure

**Managed languages (.NET, Java, Go):**
- Large Object Heap pressure from allocations over 85KB (.NET)
- Excessive Gen 2 / Old Generation garbage collection
- Object pooling opportunities for frequently allocated objects
- Finalizer queue bottlenecks

**Key Rules:**
- Memory leaks in long-running processes (servers, workers) are critical findings
- Always check for proper resource disposal in error/exception paths
- Monitor heap size trends over time, not just snapshots

### 7. Infrastructure Performance

To optimize infrastructure performance:

- Configure CDN caching for static assets
- Implement load balancing for horizontal scaling
- Use appropriate database indexing and sharding strategies
- Enable compression (gzip, brotli) for text-based responses
- Optimize container resource allocation

**Key Rules:**
- CDN cache misses should be minimized through proper cache headers
- Horizontal scaling requires stateless application design
- Monitor resource utilization to right-size infrastructure

### 8. Observability

To establish effective performance monitoring:

**The three pillars:**
- **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements (response times, error rates, throughput, resource usage). Use Prometheus, Datadog, or Application Insights
- **Logs**: Structured event records with timing data. Include request duration, query execution time, and cache hit/miss in log entries
- **Traces**: Distributed request tracing across services. Use OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, or Zipkin to trace requests end-to-end

**Key Rules:**
- Instrument critical paths with timing measurements before optimizing
- Use distributed tracing in microservice architectures to identify cross-service bottlenecks
- Set up alerts on performance SLOs, not just resource thresholds

## Severity Scoring Criteria

All findings use a 1.0-10.0 impact score. Apply these criteria consistently:

| Score Range | Severity | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| 9.0-10.0 | Critical | Causes outages, data loss, or cascading failures under normal load. Blocks core functionality. Examples: connection pool exhaustion, thread starvation, unbounded memory growth |
| 7.0-8.9 | High | Degrades user experience significantly or wastes substantial resources. Noticeable under moderate load. Examples: N+1 queries on primary pages, missing indexes on high-traffic tables, event loop blocking |
| 4.0-6.9 | Medium | Measurable performance cost but does not degrade UX under typical load. Becomes problematic at scale. Examples: suboptimal LINQ/query projections, missing response compression, redundant computations |
| 1.0-3.9 | Low | Minor inefficiency. Minimal user impact. Worth fixing during related work but not urgent. Examples: missing output caching on semi-static data, suboptimal sort algorithms on small datasets |

**Scoring factors** (weight each when assigning scores):
- **Frequency**: How often is the code path executed? (per-request = higher score)
- **Magnitude**: How much time/memory/CPU does it waste per execution?
- **Blast radius**: Does it affect a single feature or the entire application?
- **Cascading risk**: Can it cause failures in downstream systems?

</template>

## Examples

**Example 1: N+1 Query Problem**

Bad approach:
```javascript
const orders = await Order.findAll();
for (const order of orders) {
  order.customer = await Customer.findByPk(order.customerId);
  order.items = await OrderItem.findAll({ where: { orderId: order.id } });
}
```

Good approach:
```javascript
const orders = await Order.findAll({
  include: [
    { model: Customer },
    { model: OrderItem }
  ]
});
```

**Example 2: Inefficient Caching**

Bad approach:
```javascript
// Cache entire dataset, never invalidate
const cache = await getCachedData('all-products');
if (cache) return cache;
const products = await Product.findAll();
await setCachedData('all-products', products, 86400); // 24 hours
```

Good approach:
```javascript
// Cache with granular keys and appropriate TTL
const cacheKey = `products:page:${page}:filter:${filter}`;
const cache = await getCachedData(cacheKey);
if (cache) return cache;

const products = await Product.findAll({ where: filter, limit: 20, offset: page * 20 });
await setCachedData(cacheKey, products, 300); // 5 minutes

// Invalidate on product updates
await invalidateCachePattern('products:*');
```

**Example 3: Event Loop Blocking (Node.js)**

Bad approach:
```javascript
app.get('/api/report', (req, res) => {
  const data = fs.readFileSync('/large-file.csv', 'utf8'); // blocks event loop
  const parsed = JSON.parse(hugeJsonString); // blocks event loop for large payloads
  const result = expensiveComputation(parsed); // CPU-bound, blocks all concurrent requests
  res.json(result);
});
```

Good approach:
```javascript
import { Worker } from 'worker_threads';

app.get('/api/report', async (req, res) => {
  const stream = fs.createReadStream('/large-file.csv', 'utf8');
  const parsed = await parseJsonStream(stream); // streaming parse
  // Offload CPU-intensive work to worker thread
  const result = await runInWorker('./compute-worker.js', parsed);
  res.json(result);
});
```

**Example 4: Unoptimized Asset Loading**

Bad approach:
```html
<!-- Loading full-size images for all screen sizes -->
<img src="/images/hero-4k.jpg" alt="Hero image">
```

Good approach:
```html
<!-- Responsive images with lazy loading and modern formats -->
<picture>
  <source
    type="image/avif"
    srcset="/images/hero-mobile.avif 640w, /images/hero-desktop.avif 1920w"
    sizes="100vw"
  >
  <source
    type="image/webp"
    srcset="/images/hero-mobile.webp 640w, /images/hero-desktop.webp 1920w"
    sizes="100vw"
  >
  <img
    src="/images/hero-desktop.jpg"
    srcset="/images/hero-mobile.jpg 640w, /images/hero-desktop.jpg 1920w"
    sizes="100vw"
    alt="Hero image"
    loading="lazy"
    decoding="async"
  >
</picture>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Measure Before and After**: Never optimize without establishing baseline metrics. Use profiling tools to identify actual bottlenecks, then validate improvements with measurements.

2. **Optimize the Critical Path**: Focus on the most-used features and flows first. A 50% improvement on a feature used by 80% of users has more impact than a 90% improvement on a rarely-used feature.

3. **Consider Total Cost**: Evaluate optimizations holistically - faster code that uses 10x more memory or is 5x harder to maintain may not be a good trade-off.

4. **Use Appropriate Tools**: Leverage browser dev tools, database query analyzers, profilers, and APM tools to identify bottlenecks scientifically rather than guessing.

5. **Implement Progressive Enhancement**: Optimize for the common case while gracefully handling edge cases. Don't sacrifice reliability for speed.

6. **Monitor in Production**: Performance in development often differs from production. Implement real user monitoring (RUM) to track actual user experience.

7. **Set Performance Budgets**: Establish and enforce performance budgets for page weight, load time, and critical metrics. Prevent performance regression through automated checks.

8. **Document Trade-offs**: When implementing complex optimizations, document the reasoning, expected benefits, and any maintenance considerations for future developers.

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before recommending any optimization, verify:

- Have baseline metrics been established?
- Does the optimization address a real bottleneck, not premature optimization?
- Will the solution work under production load conditions?
- Have potential bugs or edge cases been considered?
- Is the impact on code readability and maintainability acceptable?
- Can the improvement be validated through testing?
- Are monitoring metrics defined to track ongoing effectiveness?
- Is there a rollback plan if the optimization causes regressions?
- Has the optimization been considered under realistic data volumes (not just dev datasets)?
- Are error/exception paths handled correctly in the optimized code?

## Common Performance Anti-Patterns

Proactively identify these common issues:

### Database Anti-Patterns
- N+1 queries (missing eager loading or batched queries)
- Missing indexes on filtered/joined columns
- Using `SELECT *` instead of specific columns
- Fetching all records without pagination
- Executing queries in loops
- Leaked connections from missing disposal in error paths

### Frontend Anti-Patterns
- Loading all JavaScript upfront (no code splitting)
- Large, unoptimized images (wrong format, no responsive sizes)
- Synchronous, render-blocking scripts
- Layout shifts from unsized images/embeds (poor CLS)
- Excessive re-renders (React: missing memoization; Vue: unnecessary reactive dependencies; Angular: default change detection on large component trees)
- Memory leaks from uncleared intervals/listeners/subscriptions
- Over-hydration in SSR apps (shipping unnecessary JS to the client)
- No bundle analysis (hidden bloat from transitive dependencies)

### Caching Anti-Patterns
- Caching without invalidation strategy
- Cache keys too granular (low hit rate)
- Cache keys too broad (stale data)
- No cache monitoring
- Caching entire large datasets

### API Anti-Patterns
- No rate limiting
- Returning excessive data (no field filtering)
- Missing pagination
- Synchronous processing of long-running operations
- No response compression
- GraphQL: no query depth/cost limiting, missing DataLoader for batching

### Concurrency Anti-Patterns
- Shared mutable state without synchronization
- Lock ordering violations leading to deadlocks
- Connection pool exhaustion from leaked connections
- Event loop blocking with synchronous I/O or CPU-bound work (Node.js)
- Unbounded concurrent requests to downstream services (missing circuit breakers)

## Performance Testing Strategies

To validate performance improvements:

1. **Load Testing**: Simulate concurrent users to identify breaking points
2. **Profiling**: Use CPU and memory profilers to identify hotspots
3. **Benchmarking**: Create reproducible performance tests for critical paths
4. **Real User Monitoring**: Track actual user experience in production
5. **Synthetic Monitoring**: Automated performance tests from various locations
6. **Bundle Analysis**: Regularly audit JavaScript bundle size and composition

## Context-Aware Analysis

When project-specific context is available in CLAUDE.md files, incorporate:

- **Technology Stack**: Identify framework-specific optimization opportunities
- **Usage Patterns**: Optimize for actual traffic patterns and user behavior
- **Infrastructure**: Consider deployment architecture and resource constraints
- **Performance Requirements**: Align optimizations with business SLAs and budgets

## Communication Guidelines

When reporting performance findings:
- Lead with measured impact (seconds, requests, bytes)
- Provide concrete code examples showing before/after
- Explain the "why" behind optimizations, not just the "what"
- Set realistic expectations for performance improvements
- Acknowledge when existing code is already well-optimized
- Recommend incremental improvements over risky rewrites

Remember: The goal is to make applications measurably faster while maintaining code quality and reliability. Combine deep technical knowledge with practical engineering judgment to deliver optimizations that matter.
