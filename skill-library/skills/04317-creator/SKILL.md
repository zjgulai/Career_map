# Skill Creator & Manager

Create, modify, install, and manage Skills. This application has one orchestrator (media-agent)
and multiple sub-agents: **image**, **video**, **audio**, **editing**.
Most Skills coordinate these agents to produce creative outputs.

## Directory Structure

| Directory | Purpose | Managed By |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| `~/.hub/skills/` | **Market-installed Skills** | Automatically managed by the app; do not modify manually |
| `~/Movies/Hub/skills/` | **User-created/edited Skills** | Full user control |

The user directory has higher priority: when Skills share the same name, the user directory version takes effect.

## Installing Skills from the Marketplace

Guide users through the in-app Skill Plaza page:

1. Open the app → go to the "Skill Plaza" page
2. Browse available Skills in the Market tab
3. Click the "Install" button
4. Enable the Skill in the Skill list after installation

Installed Skills are stored in `~/.hub/skills/`, managed by the app, with automatic updates.

---

## Skill Creation Workflow

```
1. Capture Intent   --  Understand the workflow
2. Write Skill files --  Author bilingual runtime files and metadata
3. Review & Iterate --  User feedback loop
4. Validate         --  Trigger tests + workflow walkthrough
5. Save & Reload    --  Save to user directory + trigger reload
6. Iterate (optional) -- Improve based on actual usage
```

### Three Usage Scenarios

**Scenario A: Save Current Conversation Workflow**
A workflow has already been completed in the conversation, and the user wants to solidify it as a Skill for reuse.
→ Extract the workflow from conversation history, proceed to STEP 1.

**Scenario B: Create a New Skill from Scratch**
The user has an idea but hasn't executed it yet, and wants to create a Skill directly.
→ Understand requirements through Q&A, proceed to STEP 1 (create-from-scratch branch).

**Scenario C: Modify an Existing Skill**
The user wants to adjust an existing Skill (change steps, parameters, trigger words, etc.).
→ Read the existing SKILL.md, SKILL.cn.md, and meta.yaml when present, understand modification intent, jump directly to STEP 2.

### What's Worth Saving as a Skill

Not every workflow is worth saving. Recommend saving only when at least two of the following apply:

- **Complexity**: More than 3 steps, involves multiple agents, or has branching logic
- **Reusability**: The user may repeat the same process with different inputs
- **Tacit knowledge**: Contains non-obvious techniques — model selection, parameter tuning, failure recovery strategies, creative techniques
- **Error correction history**: The user made corrections during the process that apply to future executions

If the workflow is a simple one-off operation (e.g., "generate one image"), suggest the user just describe it again next time.

---

## STEP 1: Capture Intent

### Scenario A: Extract from Conversation History

The conversation likely already contains the complete workflow. Extract from conversation history first; don't ask questions that already have answers.

#### Obtaining Conversation History

If the current context doesn't contain the complete workflow (it happened in a previous session),
use the agent's own conversation history capability to query previous session records.

**Skill Nesting**: Skills cannot nest-call other Skills. If the conversation history contains Skill invocations,
directly read the referenced Skill's SKILL.md to understand what it did — don't attempt to re-invoke it.

#### Extract from Conversation History:

1. **What happened**: Which capabilities were used, in what order
2. **Media flow**: Input (audio, images, text) → intermediate artifacts → final output
3. **Creative purpose**: Core intent
4. **Key decisions the user made**: Model selection, parameter adjustments, style direction
5. **Where things went wrong and were corrected**: Failures, retries, parameter changes — these are the most valuable knowledge
6. **What the user didn't change**: Default values working correctly is also information, indicating these parameters can remain flexible

#### Confirm Understanding

> "Here's what I extracted from the conversation: [summary]. Is this correct?"

If the user corrects or provides their own description, defer to the user's version.

### Scenario B: Create from Scratch

If there's no existing workflow, understand requirements through Q&A:

- What are the inputs? What's the final output?
- Rough sequence of steps?
- Any specific model or technical requirements?
- Any constraints (aspect ratio, duration, resolution, style consistency)?
- What's the hardest part — where does the agent tend to make mistakes?

### Scenario C: Modify an Existing Skill

1. Read the target Skill's `SKILL.md`, `SKILL.cn.md`, and `meta.yaml` when present
2. Understand what the user wants to modify
3. Jump directly to STEP 2 to make modifications, keeping bilingual files aligned. If `SKILL.cn.md` is missing, create it instead of making an English-only update.

---

## STEP 2: Write Bilingual Skill Files

### Directory Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           (required — Skill definition: name + description + system prompt)
├── SKILL.cn.md        (required — Chinese mirror: same name, localized description + body)
├── meta.yaml          (required — display metadata: display-name-zh / version / tag / summary / desc)
├── scripts/           (optional — reusable scripts)
└── references/        (optional — reference docs loaded on demand)
```

For any Skill intended for this market repo, always create all three required files: `SKILL.md`, `SKILL.cn.md`, and `meta.yaml`. The CI and pre-commit hooks reject directories under `skills/` or `user-skills/` when `SKILL.cn.md` is missing.

### Three-Layer Loading Mechanism

1. **Metadata** (name + description) — always in agent context, used for trigger matching. Keep `name` identical in `SKILL.md` and `SKILL.cn.md`.
2. **Runtime body** — `SKILL.md` is the English/default runtime file; `SKILL.cn.md` is the Chinese localized runtime file. Keep both under 500 lines and structurally aligned.
3. **Attached resources** — loaded on demand. Large docs go in `references/`, executable scripts in `scripts/`

### SKILL.md Frontmatter

SKILL.md only retains fields essential for agent runtime:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill                    # kebab-case, matches directory name
description: |
  In no more than 200 characters, state the user intent, core input and deliverable,
  applicable scenario, natural trigger wording, and an important boundary.
trigger-words: [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3, keyword4]
---
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | ✅ | Lowercase English words joined by `-`, matching the directory. See **`references/NAMING.md`** for structure and wording |
| `description` | ✅ | Trigger and routing description, no more than 200 characters when created or rewritten |
| `trigger-words` | Optional | Trigger word list |

New Skills do not add `allowed-tools`; existing fields may remain temporarily for compatibility,
but must not be expanded or copied into the body.

### SKILL.cn.md Requirements

Create `SKILL.cn.md` for every new or updated Skill:

- Use the same frontmatter keys as `SKILL.md`.
- Keep `name` exactly the same as the directory name and `SKILL.md` frontmatter.
- Localize `description` and body into Chinese while preserving the same workflow, guardrails, confirmation points, and resource references.
- Keep referenced paths identical when they point to shared files such as `references/...` or `scripts/...`.
- If only one language changes, update the other file enough to keep the two versions semantically aligned.

#### Description Writing Guidelines

- **Length**: No more than 200 characters for new or rewritten descriptions
- **Information first**: 200 characters is a ceiling, not a compression target. Do not remove the user intent, core input, main deliverable, applicable scenario, or key boundary merely to make the description shorter.
- **Tone**: Describe user intent, not implementation details
- **Coverage**: Include multiple phrasings (formal/colloquial/bilingual)
- **Boundaries**: Add brief disambiguation when similar Skills could be confused
- **Anti-pattern**: Don't write implementation steps in the description

### meta.yaml

Display metadata goes in a separate `meta.yaml`:

```yaml
display-name-zh: 广告创意脑爆          # Chinese display name, see references/NAMING.md
version: 0.1.0                       # Semantic version
tag-en: "Creative & Experimental"    # Legacy free-form string; non-empty only, not enum-checked
tag-cn: "创意实验"                    # Legacy free-form string; non-empty only
complete-tags-en:                    # YAML list; one or more "Vertical / Stage" pairs from the closed enum
  - "Creative & Experimental / Creative Generation"
complete-tags-cn:                    # Same length + same index alignment as complete-tags-en
  - "创意实验 / 创作生成"
summary-en: "One declarative sentence, up to 45 words, mirroring summary-cn."
summary-cn: "基于品牌简报与竞品参考，脑爆创意方向并产出视觉概念图，适用于 campaign 提案阶段。"
desc-en: "One paragraph, 95-130 words, five elements: positioning / input / how it works / deliverable / boundary..."
desc-cn: "一段话，150-200 汉字，五要素：定位 / 用户输入 / 使用方式 / 最终产出 / 能力边界……"
author-en: "MiniMax Design"          # Official: MiniMax Design; community: submitter's username
author-cn: "MiniMax Design"
source: official                     # official-featured | official | community (must match dir)
```

⚠️ **The single source of truth for every rule below is `spec/metadata.yml`.**
Enums and length caps come from there; the pre-commit hook and CI both read the same file.
If a limit here disagrees with `spec/metadata.yml`, the spec wins — and this doc is stale, please fix it.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `display-name-zh` | ✅ | Concise, accurate Chinese display name with no legacy 10-character hard cap. See **`references/NAMING.md`** |
| `version` | ✅ | Semantic version `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` |
| `tag-en` | ✅ | **Legacy field** — English old category, free-form string (non-empty only, no longer enum-checked). Current classification lives in `complete-tags-en` |
| `tag-cn` | ✅ | **Legacy field** — Chinese old category, free-form string (non-empty only) |
| `complete-tags-en` | ✅ | English category tags, **YAML list**. Each item `"Vertical / Stage"` from the closed enum. A skill may have multiple tags. Front-end verticals (`tags`) are derived from this |
| `complete-tags-cn` | ✅ | Chinese category tags, **YAML list**. Same length and same index alignment as `complete-tags-en`. Derive it from the English list via the spec mapping — do not translate it independently, misalignment is a hard error |
| `summary-en` | ✅ | English UI summary, ≤45 words. One declarative sentence, mirror of `summary-cn` |
| `summary-cn` | ✅ | Chinese UI summary, 30–60 Chinese chars. One declarative sentence |
| `desc-en` | ✅ | English detailed description, 95–130 words when created or rewritten. Single paragraph |
| `desc-cn` | ✅ | Chinese detailed description, 150–200 Chinese characters when created or rewritten. Single paragraph |
| `author-en` | ✅ | English author name (official → `MiniMax Design`; community → submitter's username) |
| `author-cn` | ✅ | Chinese author name (official → `MiniMax Design`; community → submitter's username) |
| `source` | ✅ | 3-value enum `official-featured` / `official` / `community`, must match dir (`skills/` → official-featured/official, `user-skills/` → community) |
| `cover` | Optional | Cover media CDN URL (16:9). Use the repository's current upload path, then validate and write URLs with `scripts/set-cover.sh` |
| `cover-en` | Optional | Cover media for English locale (same format check). Empty → falls back to `cover` |
| `showcase` | Optional | New ordered list of detail-page media URLs. Every URL must use an approved CDN domain and media extension. |
| `structured-info` | Required for all published Skills | Independent `zh-CN` / `en-US` object with `summary`, `best-for`, `how-to-use`, and `outputs`; do not derive it from legacy summary or description fields. Unpublished `_`-prefixed stubs are excluded from validation. |

The writing examples and semantic guidance for these new fields live in
`references/STRUCTURED-META-GOOD-CASES.md` and `references/STRUCTURED-META-GOOD-CASES.cn.md`.
Read them when authoring or reviewing structured card content. The machine limits remain defined
only by `spec/metadata.yml`.

The compatibility hard caps in `spec/metadata.yml` only keep unchanged historical metadata valid.
They are not authoring targets. New or rewritten descriptions follow the 200-character frontmatter
limit and the 150–200 Chinese character / 95–130 English word metadata ranges above.

#### Writing `summary-cn` / `summary-en`

One complete declarative sentence. **Must not restate the skill name** — the name already says
"what it is"; the summary adds "how" / "what it produces" / "when to use it".

> From [user input], [core processing steps], producing [final deliverable], for [use case].

#### Writing `desc-cn` / `desc-en`

One paragraph, covering five elements in order:

1. **Positioning** — which users, what problem, what scenario
2. **User input** — what the user provides, specific about format
3. **How it works** — key steps in execution order, 3–6 steps
4. **Final deliverable** — the concrete output form
5. **Capability boundary** — what it is best at, and explicitly what it does **not** handle

Full prompts with good/bad examples: `.ci/prompts/summary-*.md` and `.ci/prompts/desc-*.md`.

#### Category enum

Do not hand-copy the enum here — render it from the spec:

```bash
python3 .ci/lib/print_tag_enum.py en --pairs   # English verticals / stages / full tag set
python3 .ci/lib/print_tag_enum.py cn --pairs   # Chinese
```

`Platform Tooling` appears alone with no stage and is **exclusive** — if a skill's tag list contains
it, that must be its only tag. Otherwise a skill may carry multiple tags, e.g. a short-drama
soundtrack skill: `["Short Drama / Post-production", "Sound & Music / Creative Generation"]`.

### Body Structure

1. `# Skill Name` — Title
2. Introduction paragraph — when to use, what media types are involved
3. Step-by-step — `## STEP N: Step Name`

Use `references/SKILL-TEMPLATE.md` as a starting template.

### Writing Principles

#### Keep MCP Details Out of Authored Skills

Do not write MCP tool names, complete MCP calls, MCP call parameter names, request objects, parameter
nesting rules, or provider-specific schemas in `SKILL.md`, `SKILL.cn.md`, or `references/`. Describe
the domain action instead, such as analyzing reference material, generating keyframes, producing
video clips, or assembling the final deliverable. The runtime owns the mapping from those actions
to currently available capabilities.

#### Describe Tasks, Not Routing

- Good: "Generate a 16:9 protagonist portrait — young woman in red dress, cinematic lighting"
- Bad: "Route this step through a platform-specific image endpoint with its request fields."

#### Only Mention Models When the User Explicitly Specifies

If the user says "use Kling for video generation," record it. Don't hardcode default values that the agent selects automatically.

#### Explain the Reasoning Behind Constraints

- Good: "Remove the audio track from lip-sync clips before final compositing, because the compositing step adds the original song and duplicate tracks cause audio overlap"
- Bad: "Must use the `-an` flag"

#### Capture the Creative Process, Not Implementation Details

- Good: "Analyze the music's emotional shifts, rhythm transitions, and vocal sections"
- Bad: "Invoke a media-analysis endpoint and set its request parameters."

#### Batch Process, Don't Alternate

- Good: "Generate all scene images at once, then generate all videos at once"
- Bad: "For each segment: generate image first, then video, then move to the next"

#### Add User Confirmation at Creative Decision Points

Add confirmation steps before high-cost operations (video generation, final compositing). Don't confirm at every small step.

#### Encode User Error Corrections, Not Just the Happy Path

Retries and corrections are the most valuable knowledge.

#### Generalize from the Specific

- Good: "Analyze audio to determine section boundaries" (generic)
- Bad: "Split at 0:45, 1:30, 2:15" (file-specific)

#### All Outputs Go to the Session Project Directory

Don't hardcode output paths. Use file paths returned by tools for subsequent operations.

#### Keep Body Under 500 Lines

Move excess content to `references/`, extract executable patterns to `scripts/`.

---

## STEP 3: Review & Iterate

Present the complete `SKILL.md`, `SKILL.cn.md`, and `meta.yaml` to the user:

> "Here's the Skill I've written — anything you'd like to adjust?"

Common modifications: adjust step order, change model selection, tune parameter flexibility, add edge case handling, change trigger words, remove overly specific instructions.

---

## STEP 4: Validate

### 4a: Trigger Test

1. **Write 6 test queries** — 3 that should trigger, 3 that should not. Include both English and Chinese phrasings when the Skill is bilingual.
2. **Self-test**: Looking only at name and descriptions in `SKILL.md` / `SKILL.cn.md`, ask yourself "would this trigger?"
3. **Show the user**: Present test queries and expected results

### 4b: Workflow Walkthrough

Using a hypothetical scenario different from the original conversation, walk through step by step:

- [ ] **Completeness**: Is each step's output the input needed for the next step?
- [ ] **Generality**: Are any steps bound to specific content from the original conversation?
- [ ] **Confirmation points**: Is user confirmation placed before high-cost operations?
- [ ] **Failure paths**: Does the Skill provide guidance when generation fails?
- [ ] **Batching strategy**: Are similar resources batch-processed or alternated individually?

---

## STEP 5: Save & Reload

After user confirmation, save to the target Skill directory. For user-local Skills, use `~/Movies/Hub/skills/<skill-name>/`. For market contributions, use the repo path requested by the user, usually `skills/<skill-name>/` or `user-skills/<skill-name>/`.

### 1. Create Directory and Write Files

Set the target directory first:

- User-local Skill: `TARGET_DIR=~/Movies/Hub/skills/<skill-name>`
- Market contribution: `TARGET_DIR=<repo-path-requested-by-user>/<skill-name>` (usually `skills/<skill-name>` or `user-skills/<skill-name>`)

```bash
mkdir -p "$TARGET_DIR"
```

Save SKILL.md to `$TARGET_DIR/SKILL.md`.
Save SKILL.cn.md to `$TARGET_DIR/SKILL.cn.md`.
Save meta.yaml to `$TARGET_DIR/meta.yaml`.

If there are references or scripts, create corresponding subdirectories.

### 2. Verify Reference Integrity

After saving, confirm required files exist and all referenced files exist:

```bash
test -f "$TARGET_DIR/SKILL.md"
test -f "$TARGET_DIR/SKILL.cn.md"
test -f "$TARGET_DIR/meta.yaml"
grep -oE '(references|scripts)/[^\s`"]+' "$TARGET_DIR/SKILL.md" | \
  while read f; do
    [ -f "$TARGET_DIR/$f" ] || echo "MISSING: $f"
  done
grep -oE '(references|scripts)/[^\s`"]+' "$TARGET_DIR/SKILL.cn.md" | \
  while read f; do
    [ -f "$TARGET_DIR/$f" ] || echo "MISSING: $f"
  done
```

For market contributions, run `.ci/validate.sh` before finishing. If `SKILL.md`, `SKILL.cn.md`, or `meta.yaml` changed, set `meta.yaml` version to exactly one patch above the main-branch baseline. Keep that version unchanged across later commits on the same branch.

### 3. Trigger Skill Reload

For user-local Skills, use the product's currently available reload capability when exposed.
Do not put that runtime capability name or reload protocol into the authored Skill. If reload is not
available, tell the user when the new Skill will become visible.
For market contributions, skip local reload and report the repo path plus `.ci/validate.sh` result.

### 4. Inform the User

- Skill has been saved to `$TARGET_DIR`
- For user-local Skills, reload has been triggered; the new Skill is available in the current or next session
- For market contributions, validation has passed and the repo path is ready for commit/MR
- List the 3 trigger test queries from Step 4a as examples

---

## STEP 6: Iterate & Improve (Optional)

The first version of a Skill is rarely the best. Come back to improve after actual usage.

### Observation Signals

| Signal | Meaning | Fix |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Agent doesn't trigger the Skill | Description is missing the user's phrasing | Expand trigger words |
| Triggers but executes poorly | Instructions unclear or ambiguous | Clarify steps, add examples |
| Triggers when it shouldn't | Description too broad | Add boundary descriptions |
| Agent writes similar scripts each time | Repeated work not packaged | Extract to `scripts/` |
| User always modifies the same step | Constraints too loose | Add explicit guidance with reasoning |
| Agent does unnecessary work | Instructions cause wasted effort | Remove or simplify |

### Improvement Process

1. Collect evidence from 2-3 usage sessions
2. Diagnose: trigger issue (description), execution issue (body), or missing resource?
3. Targeted fix: only change what's broken
4. Re-validate (run Step 4 checklist)
5. After modification, use the currently available reload capability when applicable
