# Automate Customer Lifecycle Marketing Stages

## Overview

Lifecycle marketing treats each customer as being at a defined stage in their relationship with your brand—from anonymous visitor to loyal advocate—and delivers stage-appropriate messaging automatically. Unlike broadcast campaigns, lifecycle automation is triggered by behavior and stage transitions, ensuring every message is relevant. By automating these transitions, you maximize Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) without manual daily campaign management.

## When to Use This Skill

- When moving from "batch-and-blast" generic campaigns to behavior-triggered messaging.
- When different customer segments are receiving identical, irrelevant emails.
- When onboarding new customers and needing a structured "First-30-Day" nurture plan.
- When LTV and repeat purchase rate are flat despite healthy acquisition numbers.
- When building a holistic view of the customer journey across email, SMS, and push notifications.

## Lifecycle Stage Definitions & Transition Triggers

Mapping the journey requires clear definitions and the specific events that move a customer from one stage to the next.

| Stage | Definition | Transition Trigger (Entry) | Primary Goal |
|-------|-----------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Subscriber** | Email captured, 0 orders | Newsletter Signup / Pop-up submit | Convert to first purchase |
| **First-time Buyer** | 1 order total | `Placed Order` (Total = 1) | Onboard, reduce returns, build habit |
| **Active/Repeat** | 2-3 orders total | `Placed Order` (Total > 1) | Grow AOV and purchase frequency |
| **Loyal (VIP)** | 4+ orders OR > $500 LTV | `Placed Order` (Total >= 4) | Protect from churn, reward, upsell |
| **At-Risk** | Approaching 1.5x avg repurchase window | `Time since last order` > X days | Proactive re-engagement |
| **Lapsed** | Beyond 2x avg repurchase window | `Time since last order` > 2X days | Win-back campaign / Sunset |
| **Advocate** | Has reviewed or referred | `Review Submitted` / `Referral Made` | UGC generation & social proof |

### Segment Size & Statistical Significance
Before launching a specialized lifecycle flow, ensure your segment meets minimum size thresholds:
- **Triggered Flows:** Minimum 50-100 entries per month to gather actionable data.
- **A/B Testing within Flows:** Minimum 1,000 recipients per variant to reach statistical significance (>95% confidence) on conversion rates.

## Core Instructions

### Step 1: Mapping the Flow Logic (Platform-Agnostic)

Regardless of your Email Service Provider (ESP), the logic for lifecycle automation follows a consistent structure of **Triggers**, **Filters**, and **Delays**.

#### 1. Welcome Sequence (Subscriber Stage)
- **Trigger:** Joined List.
- **Flow Filter:** Has placed 0 orders since starting this flow.
- **Logic:**
  - Day 0 (Immediate): Deliver incentive + Brand "Why".
  - Day 2: Founder story / Social proof.
  - Day 5: Educational content (How to use/style).
  - Day 10: "Final call" for first-order discount.

#### 2. Onboarding & Habit Building (First-Time Buyer Stage)
- **Trigger:** Placed Order.
- **Flow Filter:** Total Order Count equals 1.
- **Logic:**
  - Day 1: Order confirmation + "What to expect" shipping info.
  - Day 3: Product setup/care guide.
  - Day 14: Value-add content (tips/tricks).
  - Day 21: Review request (UGC generation).

#### 3. VIP / Loyalty Flow (Loyal Stage)
- **Trigger:** Segment Entry (LTV > $500 or Orders >= 4).
- **Logic:**
  - Immediate: "Welcome to the Inner Circle" (Special status unlocked).
  - Ongoing: Early access to new drops (24h before public).
  - Conditional: Free shipping on all orders or exclusive gift with next purchase.

#### 4. Churn Prevention (At-Risk Stage)
- **Trigger:** Segment Entry (Last order > 1.5x average repurchase cycle).
- **Logic:**
  - Step 1: Personalized "We miss you" with dynamic product recommendations based on past purchases.
  - Step 2: "Is everything okay?" feedback request.
  - Step 3: High-value discount (e.g., 20% off) to secure the re-purchase.

### Step 2: Channel Mix by Stage

Optimize your budget and customer attention by using the right channel for the right stage.

| Stage | Primary Channel | Secondary Channel | Focus |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Subscriber** | Email | Paid Social (Retargeting) | Education & Incentive |
| **First-time Buyer** | Email | SMS (Shipping updates) | Product Success |
| **Active** | Email | In-app / Push | Discovery & Cross-sell |
| **Loyal** | VIP Email | SMS (Early access) | Exclusivity & Reward |
| **At-Risk** | Email | SMS (High-urgency) | Re-engagement |
| **Lapsed** | Paid Social (Sync) | Direct Mail | Win-back |

### Step 3: Performance Benchmarks

Monitor these targets to validate your automation strategy:

| Metric | Target | Lifecycle Impact |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Subscriber → First Purchase** | > 10% within 30 days | Validates Welcome Flow effectiveness. |
| **Repeat Purchase Rate (90d)** | > 30% for 1st-time buyers | Validates Onboarding Flow. |
| **At-Risk Saved Rate** | > 20% conversion | Validates Churn Prevention Flow. |
| **Loyal Share of Revenue** | > 40% of total revenue | Indicates healthy brand health and LTV. |

## Best Practices

- **Priority Suppression:** Ensure a customer is not in multiple lifecycle flows at once. Use "Exit if in Segment X" logic.
- **Dynamic Content:** Use dynamic blocks to show products based on previous category purchases (e.g., don't show coffee beans to someone who only buys tea).
- **Conditional Splits:** Use splits based on AOV. High-AOV buyers ($200+) should get more personalized, high-touch messaging than low-AOV buyers ($20).
- **Predictive Analytics:** If using advanced ESPs (like Klaviyo), use "Expected Next Purchase Date" as the trigger for At-Risk flows instead of a static "90 days" rule.

## Common Pitfalls

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Over-messaging** | Implement a "Smart Sending" rule (e.g., no more than 1 email per 16-hour window) across all flows. |
| **Irrelevant Coupons** | Ensure loyal customers don't receive deep discounts intended for win-backs; it erodes margin and brand value. |
| **Static Timing** | If your product is a 30-day supply, don't send a "Refill" email at 60 days. Align delays with product consumption. |
| **Broken Attribution** | Ensure UTM parameters are unique to each lifecycle stage so you can see which flow is driving the most LTV. |
| **Lack of SMS Opt-in** | Lifecycle stages often fail because of low email open rates. Prioritize SMS opt-in for VIP and At-Risk segments. |
