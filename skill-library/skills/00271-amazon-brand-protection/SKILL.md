# Amazon Brand Protection

## The Brand Protection Stack

Amazon provides a layered set of protection tools. Use them in combination:


| Tool                         | Access Requirement          | What It Does                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Brand Registry**           | Registered trademark        | Foundation tool; unlocks all other protections                      |
| **IP Alert**                 | Brand Registry              | Alerts you when suspected infringers appear on your listings        |
| **Transparency**             | Brand Registry              | Serializes units with unique codes; counterfeit units can't be sold |
| **Project Zero**             | Brand Registry + invitation | AI-powered proactive counterfeit removal; self-service removal      |
| **Report a Violation (RAV)** | Brand Registry              | Submit IP infringement claims directly                              |

## Listing Hijacker Detection & Response

**What is a hijacker?**
An unauthorized seller who adds themselves as an offer on your branded listing,
often selling counterfeit or grey-market goods at lower prices.

**Detection signals:**

- Buy Box lost to an unknown seller
- Sudden appearance of new sellers on your listing
- Customer complaints about product quality or different packaging
- Reviews mentioning "not the same as described"

**How to check:** Seller Central → Inventory → Manage Inventory → click the number in "Offers" column

**Response protocol (in order):**

**Step 1: Test buy** (most effective first step)
Purchase one unit from the hijacker's offer.
When it arrives, if it's counterfeit or different: you have physical evidence for Amazon's enforcement team.

**Step 2: Cease and desist message**
Send a professional message via Buyer-Seller Messaging: "You are selling on a listing owned by [Brand]. This is a trademark violation. Remove your offer within 48 hours or we will file an IP complaint with Amazon and pursue legal action."
(Many hijackers remove themselves after receiving this.)

**Step 3: Report a Violation (RAV)**
Brand Registry → Report a Violation → Submit the ASIN + hijacker's seller ID + evidence
Amazon typically acts within 3-5 business days.

**Step 4: Transparency enrollment** (preventive)
Apply units with unique QR codes. Amazon's systems and customers can verify authenticity.
Counterfeit units without valid Transparency codes cannot be sold on your listing.

## Protecting Against False IP Complaints

Your listing can be taken down if a competitor files a false IP complaint against you.

**Prevention:**

- Register your trademark before scaling
- Keep records of all product photography, packaging, and design files with timestamps
- Document your brand development history (design files, launch dates, marketing materials)
- Never use stock photos that might be owned by a third party

**Response to a false complaint:**

1. Identify the complainant from Amazon's complaint notice
2. Send a counter-notice via Seller Central → Performance → Account Health → Intellectual Property Complaints
3. Provide evidence that you own the rights or have license to use the content
4. If the complaint is clearly false (DMCA abuse), you can sue the complainant in US federal court
