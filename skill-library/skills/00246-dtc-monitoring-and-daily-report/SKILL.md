# Shopify Monitoring & Daily Report

## 🚨 Hard Rules (read first, violations cause incidents)

1. **Rule 1 — Minimize user burden**: Always label every step with 🤖 **Agent does**, 👤 **User must do**, or 👤 **User must provide**. Never push work back to the user that the agent can do via API.
   | Symbol | Who does it | Examples |
   |---|---|---|
   | 🤖 **Agent does** | Agent uses the owning plugin capability | API reads, supported non-theme writes, local report/config files, decorator-owned theme tasks, schedule setup |
   | 👤 **User must do** | Hard merchant-only barrier | App install OAuth, App Embed toggle |
   | 👤 **User must provide** | One-time credential / ID hand-off | Project ID, Tokens |
2. **Rule 2 — Verify SaaS URLs**: Deep paths to 3rd-party settings MUST be `web_search`-verified before being shown. Annotate verification dates in reference files.
3. **Rule 3 — Internal model vs External presentation**: Never leak raw scores or internal maturity metrics.
   | Layer | Used for | NEVER show user |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Internal model** | Decisions, scoring, branching | Raw scores, "MVP-tier", "store maturity = 3/10" |
   | **External presentation** | What the user reads | Plain business language, no jargon |
4. **Rule 4 — Use the 3-beat handoff**: Every request for user input MUST include: (1) what I already did, (2) what I need from you, and (3) what happens next. (Reference: `references/00-stage0-opening-script.md`)

Keep long-lived Shopify access tokens and Clarity JWTs in their managed Connectors whenever that path is available. Do not ask for or store raw tokens in that case. An unconnected Connector follows its connection flow; it is not evidence that the managed path is unavailable. Manual fallback belongs only to the explicitly supported self-hosted/unavailable-Connector branch.

Build a complete monitoring stack for a Shopify store from zero, then automate a daily Markdown report. **Designed to minimize the user's operational burden** — the agent handles all Shopify Admin work via the plugin's existing skill chain; the user only does what is technically merchant-only (App install OAuth, Custom Pixel paste, App Embed toggle).

## When to use

- Install reviews / heatmap / analytics tools on a Shopify store
- Build a daily dashboard or report
- Monitor store metrics automatically
- Understand UX / conversion problems with data
- Get scheduled email / Slack alerts about store health

**Do NOT use for**: one-off page conversion fixes (use `optimize-ecommerce-page-conversion`), ad campaign optimization (route through the host's paid-acquisition capability), SEO audits (use the `shopify-marketing` classic SEO track), or generic Shopify store building (use `dtc-builder`).

---

## How this skill collaborates with the plugin (read first)

This skill is the **orchestration layer**. It does NOT re-implement Shopify auth, GraphQL, or Liquid editing — those are owned by other plugin skills. **Always delegate**:

Before live store access, verify the current connection with `aw-shopify-oauth`, then load [`shopify-execution`](../shopify-execution/SKILL.md) before using the Admin/CLI Skills below. It owns Accio execution compatibility and the Main Agent Route C write gate. This Skill owns monitoring setup, report evidence, and patrol state; recommendations and recurring runs never authorize publication. No Shopify connection is needed for advice that uses no live store data.

| What you need to do | Delegate to | Never do this instead |
|---|---|---|
| Authenticate to Shopify | **Accio Work Connector** (Sidebar → Capabilities → Plugins → Shopify (plugin detail page) → scroll down to App Authorization (应用授权) → Shopify Store Auth (Shopify店铺授权)) | ❌ Custom App + `client_credentials` token exchange <br>❌ Manual `shpat_*` token handling |
| Authenticate to Microsoft Clarity (Data Export API) | **Accio Work Connector** (Sidebar → Capabilities → Plugins → Shopify → Connectors → Microsoft Clarity) — single login spawns the local `@microsoft/clarity-mcp-server`. Falls back to manual `CLARITY_API_TOKEN` only when Connector is unavailable. | ❌ Asking user to paste a JWT token when Connector is connected <br>❌ Re-implementing Clarity REST against `data-export.clarity.microsoft.com` with hand-managed tokens |
| Read Shopify data (orders, products, shop info) | `shopify-admin` (validate GraphQL) → `shopify-use-shopify-cli` (`shopify store execute --query '...'`) | ❌ `curl https://{store}/admin/api/...` <br>❌ Direct REST against `/admin/api/{version}/orders.json` |
| Write supported non-theme Shopify data | `shopify-admin` → `shopify-use-shopify-cli` with `--allow-mutations` | ❌ Treat a missing Admin field as permission to alter the theme |
| Install or update an analytics snippet/theme hook | `shopify-theme-decorator`; pass the approved instrumentation outcome and verification criteria | ❌ Write theme files inline, even for a one-line or known-file patch |
| Author Liquid snippets / sections | `shopify-theme-decorator` owns the result and may consult `shopify-liquid` | ❌ Author or deploy Liquid from this monitoring track |
| Send the report by email | `gmail-assistant` skill (already in plugin) | ❌ Hand-roll a Python `smtplib` / Gmail API integration |
| Schedule the report | Built-in `cron` tool with relative paths | ❌ Hardcoded absolute `/Users/...` paths |
| Detect newly eligible products | `shopify-new-product-monitor` + `evaluate_growth_triggers.py` | ❌ Let a model infer whether a product is new |
| Recommend a seven-day Campaign | `shopify-social-campaign`, only for `campaign_recommendation.matched == true` | ❌ Treat the recommendation as a social action or publish consent |
| Create and publish social content | `shopify-marketing` social track, only after draft activation and exact-content confirmation | ❌ Auto-publish from the patrol |

**Hard rule — the only supported direct Shopify API path** in this skill is the `shopify-admin` + `shopify-use-shopify-cli` chain for reads and supported non-theme resources. The decorator authors and verifies theme-file changes, including the analytics snippet and its one-line render hook. For an applicable local visual-preview cycle, Main may manage only [Theme Craft’s bounded directory synchronization](../shopify-theme-craft/references/dev-preview-craft.md#4-local-development-preview-and-full-tree-workflows); this does not allow monitoring to edit theme files or create a second upload channel. Nonvisual instrumentation can use the existing narrow remote path without local preview. The Python report scripts reuse the plugin's shared managed CLI launcher for reads and do not hold or refresh tokens themselves. Copied scripts require the framework's `PHOENIX_PLUGIN_ROOT_SHOPIFY_PLUGIN` and `PHOENIX_PLUGIN_CLI_SHOPIFY_CLI_PATH`, plus Node in the task environment; missing runtime setup is a plugin-repair request, not permission to install a global Shopify CLI.

**Hard rule — long-lived 3rd-party tokens go through Accio Work Connectors.** Currently managed: **Shopify** + **Microsoft Clarity**. When a Connector is registered (check `~/.accio/accounts/<id>/connectors/data/<service>/state.json`), the agent MUST use the Connector flow first and only fall back to a hand-pasted token when the Connector is unavailable or the user has explicitly opted out. Never ask the user to paste a Clarity JWT or a Shopify access token if the Connector can supply it. The fetch script (`templates/scripts/fetch_clarity.py`) implements the dual-path internally — Connector first, token fallback — so callers only set `clarity.use_connector: true` (default) in `store-config.json`.

---

## 5-Stage Roadmap

This roadmap applies to a requested monitoring/reporting setup. For a narrower
request, select only its steps. Installing a supplied analytics Project ID does
not require Data Export OAuth, a report, a schedule, or publication when the user
requested draft-only delivery. Reuse existing IDs, installations and approvals.

```
Stage 0  Discovery & Goals      → Self-introduce + default path (no interrogation)
Stage 1  Foundation              → Confirm Shopify auth via Connector
Stage 2  Eyes (Tools)            → Microsoft Clarity
Stage 2.5 Reviews (opt-in)       → Judge.me, only when ≥ 50 orders/month
Stage 3  Brain (Report Script)   → Configure & test daily report
Stage 3.5 Social Patrol (opt-in) → New-product Campaign recommendations
Stage 4  Heartbeat (Automation)  → Cron schedule + (optional) email push
Stage 5  Iterate                 → Add metrics as the store grows
```

Announce the applicable stage entered, and report completed stages without adding new approval gates.

---

## Stage 0 — Self-introduce & set default path

🚨 **Do NOT open with "let me ask you 3 questions"** — the user came because they don't know what to ask. Lead with what you'll build.

The opening message has 4 beats: (1) what I'll build, (2) what the daily report will contain, (3) cost & time (numbers from `references/00-verified-urls.md` so they stay current), (4) the default route + 4 specific opt-out signals.

**Full opening script template, opt-out variants in both languages, language-matching rules, and the rule against inlining sample report files** — see [`references/00-stage0-opening-script.md`](references/00-stage0-opening-script.md).

After the user gives any "go" signal, **do not ask more questions**. Profile silently from context (Connector status, `shop.json`, installed apps, MEMORY) and ask only when technically required.

---

## Stage 1 — Foundation: Confirm Shopify auth

This skill assumes Shopify is connected via the Accio Work Connector. **No Custom App, no token exchange, no `shpat_*` handling.**

### Step 1.0 — 🤖 Agent does: Confirm Connector is connected

Decision tree:
- The current `aw-shopify-oauth` result verifies the Connector grant for this store → continue to the required access/scope check below; MEMORY is context, not current connection evidence
- User hasn't connected yet → guide through the 3-step Connector flow (`Sidebar → Capabilities → Plugins → Shopify (plugin detail page) → scroll down to App Authorization (应用授权) → Shopify Store Auth (Shopify店铺授权) Store Auth (Shopify店铺授权) → Connect`); language-match the user's first message
- User can't find the Connector entry → ask for a screenshot, then escalate to [`references/99-fallback-self-hosted.md`](references/99-fallback-self-hosted.md) (Custom App fallback, NON-Accio-Work users only)

Load `aw-shopify-oauth` and inspect the current Connector grant before reading store data, then load `shopify-execution` for the Admin/CLI execution contract. Order KPIs require the optional `read_orders` scope; it is not part of the default grant. If it is missing, follow the OAuth Skill's scope-expansion flow before running the report. Read-only monitoring does not require `write_orders` or `read_all_orders`.

### Step 1.1 — 🤖 Agent does: Verify access via `shopify store execute`

Validate via `shopify-admin` first, then run via `shopify-use-shopify-cli`. Minimal sanity probe (a `shop` query) — this confirms the Connector is wired correctly before any further work:

```bash
shopify store execute --store {DOMAIN} -j --no-color \
  --query 'query { shop { name primaryDomain { url } ianaTimezone currencyCode } }'
```

Persist `shop.ianaTimezone` and `shop.currencyCode` to `project/store-config.json` — the report scripts read these at runtime instead of hardcoding.

### Step 1.2 — 🤖 Agent does: Request the unified analytics instrumentation

First verify whether an existing app embed, analytics integration, or theme instrumentation already covers the requested provider. If a theme-file change is still required, send `shopify-theme-decorator` the approved provider IDs, desired storefront behavior, current-install evidence, protected theme behavior, and success criteria. The decorator owns implementation and self-checks; `shopify-store-auditor` performs scoped dev/production acceptance. Main coordinates audit, fixes, publication and final state through [Reference 02](references/02-analytics-snippet-pattern.md#publication-and-production-verification); no live-install claim follows from dev-only evidence.

Implementation outcome and verification pattern: see [`references/02-analytics-snippet-pattern.md`](references/02-analytics-snippet-pattern.md). It is a decorator brief, not permission for this Skill to deploy files.

> **Detect existing installation before re-running this step.** If `snippets/analytics-snippet.liquid` already exists in the theme, read it first and check for an existing Clarity Project ID. Missing Data Export access is a remaining step only when reporting/data access was requested: skip duplicate Pixel injection and resume the applicable Connector step in [`references/04-install-clarity.md`](references/04-install-clarity.md). It does not make an otherwise verified installation incomplete.

---

## Stage 2 — Eyes: Data Foundation (Clarity, ~5 min)

> **Why Judge.me is NOT in Stage 2**: Reviews data only becomes meaningful once a store has actual customers (rule of thumb: ≥ 50 orders/month). Defer to Stage 2.5.

### 2A — Microsoft Clarity (UX heatmap & session recordings)

Reference: [`references/04-install-clarity.md`](references/04-install-clarity.md)

| Step | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 👤 | Sign up at clarity.microsoft.com, create Project for the store |
| 2 | 👤 must provide | Project ID — left sidebar **Settings → Overview** tab → **Project ID** at top of page (Copy icon). Note: the create-project dialog has no "E-commerce" option — pick **Retail** for Website industry. |
| 3 | 🤖 / 👤 only if needed | For requested Data Export/reporting, use the managed Connector; manual token handoff is limited to Reference 04's supported fallback. Skip for installation only. |
| 4 | 🤖 | Send the approved Project ID and current-install evidence to `shopify-theme-decorator`; the decorator owns the snippet update and render hook |
| 5 | 🤖 | Follow Reference 02: scoped auditor dev-preview checks → Main's completion decision for preview-only delivery, or authorized publication and scoped production audit when live installation was requested. A development-theme receipt alone does not establish live installation. |

**API rate limit**: Clarity Data Export API allows only **10 calls/day** — daily report calls max 1-2 times.

---

## Stage 2.5 — Reviews System (opt-in, conditional)

**Default behavior**: SKIP on first install. Trigger only when ≥ 1 fires:
- User explicitly says "install Judge.me / set up reviews"
- Store crosses **≥ 50 orders/month** (agent detects via a Shopify order-count query in Stage 4 weekly check)
- Store has ≥ 10 reviews collected via another channel (Trustpilot / Etsy / etc.)

### Pre-flight check (before any install)

Run the order-count query, and if `< 50` proactively recommend deferral:

> "Your store has X orders in the last 30 days. Reviews tools work best with ≥ 50 monthly orders — installing now would put a '0 reviews' badge on every product page, which can lower trust. **My recommendation: skip Judge.me for now, I'll automatically remind you when orders cross 50.** Want to proceed anyway, or wait?"

If `≥ 50`, confirm once: *"You're at X orders/month — good time to add reviews. Install Judge.me now?"*

### Install (only if pre-flight passes)

Reference: [`references/03-install-judgeme.md`](references/03-install-judgeme.md). Workflow: user installs from App Store (OAuth) → user enables App Embed in Theme Editor → agent verifies widget on PDP and confirms review metafields are synced → reviews section auto-appears in the report. **No API token step** — Judge.me syncs its review summary into Shopify shop metafields (namespace `judgeme`), which the report reads via the same Connector.

**Free vs Paid**: Free tier already syncs review count/average into Shopify metafields, which is all the daily report needs. Paid plans add branding and advanced settings — verify current pricing via web_search before quoting numbers.

---

## Stage 3 — Brain: Configure & Test the Daily Report

### 3.1 — 🤖 Agent does: Initialise scripts and config

```bash
mkdir -p project/scripts project/daily-reports
cp templates/scripts/*.py project/scripts/
cp templates/store-config.example.json project/store-config.json
```

Edit `project/store-config.json` (NOT the scripts) and fill in:
- `shop_domain` (e.g. `your-shop.myshopify.com`)
- `clarity` → `project_id`, `api_token` (or `null` to skip)
- `judgeme` → nothing to configure; reviews are read from Shopify metafields if the Judge.me app is installed (auto-skipped otherwise)
- `language` (auto-detected from user's locale; defaults to `en`)

Timezone and currency are pulled at runtime from Shopify (`shop.ianaTimezone`, `shop.currencyCode`) — no hardcoded `+8` / `USD`. The shared CLI launcher pins Admin API `2026-07` from `shopify-admin/data/supported-versions-schema.json`; search and validate report queries with `--version 2026-07` before changing them.

### 3.2 — 🤖 Agent does: Dry-run mock first

Before the user has fully wired Clarity / Judge.me, run a **mock report** so they see the template against their real store identity (only `shop.json` is queried — all other sections show "N/A — not yet configured"):

```bash
python3 project/scripts/daily_report.py --mock
```

This converts the install decision from "install blind, then see what you get" to "see the template, then decide what to wire up".

### 3.3 — 🤖 Agent does: Real test run

Once tokens are filled in:

```bash
python3 project/scripts/daily_report.py
```

Each data source is wrapped in its own `try/except` block. If Clarity rate-limits, that section shows "rate-limited — retry in N hours" and the rest of the report still renders. Single-source failures never crash the script.

### 3.4 — Report sections (template defaults)

- **Header**: date (in store timezone), generation timestamp, data sources
- **Core KPIs**: Revenue / Orders / AOV / Active Products (always — Shopify Connector); Sessions / CVR (when Clarity is configured, CVR is computed as Shopify paid orders ÷ Clarity human sessions — a trend approximation, not a channel-accurate figure) — each with 🟢🟡🔴 health badge
- **Traffic profile** (Clarity Data Export): Country / Device / Browser / Top 5 pages / Referrers
- **UX health** (Clarity Data Export): Rage Clicks / Dead Clicks / Quick Backs / JS Errors / Excessive Scroll — **with plain-language explanations inline**
- **Reviews**: rendered only when Judge.me is configured (Stage 2.5)
- **Today's insights**: rule-engine-generated observations
- **Social Campaign patrol**: deterministic new-product and optional Campaign decisions, report-safe recommendation cards, and social action states; never generated captions or Connector payloads
- **Single recommended action for today** (not a list of 10)
- **Direct links**: store, Shopify Admin, Clarity, Judge.me — all built from `store-config.json`

Internal schema references (English-only, **agent/developer-facing — do NOT inline into chat**): `templates/sample-report-mvp.md` (free tier) and `templates/sample-report-mature.md` (with Judge.me). Use them to understand the expected output shape; describe the report to users in their own language instead.

### 3.5 — 🤖 Agent does: Run the optional social patrol

Copy `patrol_store.py`, `evaluate_growth_triggers.py`, and `shopify-marketing/scripts/social_publish_preflight.py` into `project/scripts/` with the report scripts when social actions are enabled. The evaluator owns only `new_product` and `campaign_recommendation`; it never generates content. Follow `shopify-new-product-monitor` for scan, commit, and snapshot receipts. Commit persists pending requests before the cursor. Process every pending `recommendation_requests` entry from the snapshot through `shopify-social-campaign`, including requests saved before an interruption. Include only validated report-safe recommendation fields in `--growth-result`.

- `matched=false`: create no new recommendation request; still resume previously pending requests from the snapshot.
- `matched=null`: report unknown and create nothing.
- `start_draft`: authorize drafts only; require a successful `campaign create` receipt before reporting durable `planned` slots, then load the `shopify-marketing` social track for content.
- `patrol commit` owns the ordering: save the pending recommendation request, then advance the product cursor. It is not proof that a recommendation was evaluated or delivered. `recommendation record` persists the deterministic decision; unknown decisions stay pending. A failed report may be rebuilt from saved receipts without rescanning newness or creating publishing actions.
- No scheduled run may publish. Every social action needs deterministic preflight plus the current exact `payload_hash` confirmation. Never report `scheduled` or promise a reminder from a proposed timestamp alone.
- Treat patrol status reads as observation only. Publishing uses the execution ID and lease returned by `action begin`; only explicit recovery may fail an expired lease, and the same execution ID must heartbeat/finish the action.

---

## Stage 4 — Heartbeat: Automation (5 min)

### 4.1 — 🤖 Agent does: Schedule daily cron (agent-triggered)

**Hard rule A — store-patrol cron MUST use `payload.kind: "agent"`, NEVER `kind: "command"`.**

The scheduled store-patrol / 巡店 daily report is **agent-triggered**, not tool-/command-triggered. Every fire re-enters the agent loop so the run inherits Connector auth (Shopify + Microsoft Clarity), skill routing, error diagnosis, and a follow-up window for next-step actions. A raw shell cron has none of these — when a Connector token rotates or the report shows a structural issue, a `kind: "command"` job fails silently with no traceable agent log.

**Hard rule B — report copy language MUST follow the user's input language, constrained to the plugin's i18n whitelist (snapshot at cron creation; out-of-range falls back to `en`).**

The daily report's user-facing copy (KPI labels, plain-language glosses, section headers, UX-issue descriptions, and the agent's chat-side run summary) MUST be rendered in the user's input language **if and only if** that language is in the **effective whitelist**:

> **Effective whitelist = `resources/i18n.json` locales ∩ `render_report.py` STRINGS keys.**
>
> Both layers must support the locale, because i18n.json only governs the plugin's metadata/labels surface, while `render_report.py` governs the actual report Markdown. As of the latest version both layers support `en` and `zh`; any other user input language (e.g. `ja`, `de`, `es`) is **out of range** and MUST fall back to `en` until the whitelist is extended.
>
> Default locale (and out-of-range fallback) = `resources/i18n.json` → `defaultLocale` (currently `en`).

Operational steps the agent runs when creating the cron:

1. **Detect** the user's input language at the moment the cron is created (read the user's latest message — Chinese chars dominate → `zh`, otherwise classify by script/keywords). Call the detected code `<detected>`.
2. **Resolve against the whitelist** to get `<effective>`:
   - Read `resources/i18n.json` and gather the union of locale codes across `entries` (currently `{en, zh, es, pt, fr, de, ja, ko, it}`).
   - Read `render_report.py` STRINGS top-level keys (currently `{en, zh, es, pt, fr, de, ja, ko, it}`).
   - `whitelist = i18n_locales ∩ STRINGS_keys`. `default = i18n.json.defaultLocale` (`en`).
   - `<effective> = <detected> if <detected> in whitelist else <default>`.
   - When falling back, tell the user once in their input language: "The daily report is not yet localized in `<detected>`, so it will render in English. (To add a locale, extend `render_report.py` STRINGS and `i18n.json` entries.)" — do NOT silently downgrade.
3. **Snapshot** `<effective>` into `project/store-config.json` → `language` field (overwrite any prior value, including `"auto"`). `daily_report.py` and `render_report.py` honor `cfg["language"]`; if the value is somehow out of range at run time the script itself has a final-line fallback to `en`.
4. **Echo `<effective>` in the cron payload's `message`** — both the instructions *to* the agent and the agent's subsequent KPI summary back to the user MUST use that **effective** (rendered) language, NOT the raw `<detected>` language. This guarantees the chat summary matches the actual report Markdown; otherwise the user sees a zh chat ribbon over an en report (or vice-versa).
5. **Re-resolve on language switch.** If a future turn shows the user has switched language, run steps 1–4 again and `cron update` + rewrite `store-config.json` `language`. Same fallback-to-`en` rule applies.

> ⚠️ Do not fall back to `shop.primaryLocale` for the report. The shop locale tracks **shoppers'** language, not the founder's. A US-domain store run by a 中文 founder still needs a 中文 report (when zh is in the whitelist).

Always use the **relative project path**, not absolute — different users will install in different locations:

```javascript
// (a) Detect + whitelist-resolve user input language, snapshot <effective> into store-config.json.
//     Pseudo-step the agent runs in the same turn:
//       detected   = detect_user_input_language(latest_user_message)            // e.g. "zh" / "en" / "ja"
//       whitelist  = i18n_json_locales ∩ render_report_STRINGS_keys             // currently {"en","zh","es","pt","fr","de","ja","ko","it"}
//       effective  = detected if detected in whitelist else "en"                // out-of-range → en
//       edit  project/store-config.json  →  "language": "<effective>"
//
// (b) Create the cron with the SAME <effective> language embedded.
cron({
  action: "add",
  name: "Daily Store Patrol Report",
  schedule: { kind: "cron", expr: "0 9 * * *", tz: "{shop.ianaTimezone from store-config.json}" },
  payload: {
    kind: "agent",
    // Example shown with effective = "zh". For effective = "en" rewrite the whole message in English.
    // Critical: the language tag inside the message MUST equal store-config.json language,
    // and the agent's chat summary on each run MUST use the same language.
    message: "执行今日店铺巡检（输出语种 = zh，已与 store-config.json language 字段一致；若 zh 不在白名单则改用 en）：(1) 运行 `project/scripts/daily_report.py` 生成最新日报；(2) 校验输出文件 `project/daily-reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md` 存在且 > 1KB；(3) 用 zh 摘要今日 KPI（订单数 / 会话数 / CVR / Clarity UX 异常项）一行汇报；(4) 若脚本失败，按 `references/04-install-clarity.md` 与 `templates/README-config.md` 的故障排查表诊断原因（Connector 失效 / Clarity 配额耗尽 / store-config 缺字段等）并用 zh 简短报告。Do NOT silently fail. Do NOT switch language mid-report."
  }
})
```

> 🌐 **EN-effective variant** — when `<effective>` is `en` (either because the user wrote in English OR because the user's language was out of whitelist), the entire payload `message` (and the agent's later chat summary) must be in English. Replace the zh string above with its English equivalent.

> ⚠️ **Forbidden alternative (A)** — do NOT use `payload: { kind: "command", command: "cd ${WORKSPACE} && python3 project/scripts/daily_report.py" }`. A pure shell cron cannot see the Accio Work Connector store, cannot recover from token rotation, and cannot continue the chain (e.g. trigger an email push via `gmail-assistant` when KPI thresholds break). The script itself stays the same — only the **trigger** changes from tool to agent.

> ⚠️ **Forbidden alternative (B)** — do NOT leave `store-config.json` → `language` as `"auto"` after the cron is created. `"auto"` is only the seed default; once the user has actually spoken, snapshot the concrete `<effective>` code (`en` / `zh` / a future whitelisted locale). Leaving `"auto"` causes `daily_report.py` to default to `en` regardless of who the founder is, which is correct as a tail-end safety net but is NOT a substitute for the snapshot — the cron's chat summary still needs to know the rendered language.

> ⚠️ **Forbidden alternative (C)** — do NOT snapshot `<detected>` directly (skipping the whitelist check). If you write `language: "ja"` while STRINGS only has `en` + `zh`, `render_report.py` silently falls back to `en` for the Markdown, but if the agent chat summary uses `ja` you ship a split-language run. ALWAYS write `<effective>`, not `<detected>`.

> Note: Hard rule A applies ONLY to the **store-patrol** daily-report cron. Downstream secondary crons explicitly designed as agent-mode (e.g. the email-push job in [`references/08-push-notifications.md`](references/08-push-notifications.md)) already follow this pattern. Pure non-store webhooks (e.g. a Slack-only `curl` webhook) may remain `kind: "command"` since they do not touch store data. Hard rule B (language whitelist + fallback) applies to **all** user-facing report copy and agent summaries, no matter which cron triggers them.

Recommended time: **09:00 in the store's local timezone** — fresh report when the merchant starts their day. If the user wants a specific timezone, override `tz`; otherwise use the value persisted from Shopify in Stage 1.

### 4.2 — Verify next run

Wait 30 seconds after `cron add` (the scheduler populates `state.nextRunAtMs` asynchronously), then `cron list` → confirm `state.nextRunAtMs` is populated and < `now + 24h`.

### 4.3 — Optional: Push to email / Slack

**Email** (recommended for solo founders): **delegate to the `gmail-assistant` skill** — do NOT write a custom `email_report.py`. After cron runs, hand the rendered Markdown file to `gmail-assistant` for delivery. Pattern detailed in [`references/08-push-notifications.md`](references/08-push-notifications.md).

**Slack** (for teams): Slack incoming webhook. See same reference.

## Stage 5 — Iterate (Ongoing)

| Trigger | Add to report |
|---|---|
| Sessions ≥ 50/day | Begin tracking attribution (which channel converts) |
| Orders ≥ 10/day | Add cart abandonment rate, return rate |
| Inventory issues | Add low-stock alerts |
| Multi-channel (Pinterest/IG live) | Add per-channel CVR breakdown |
| Email list grows | Add Klaviyo/Omnisend metrics |

Each data source is its own script (`fetch_shopify.py`, `fetch_clarity.py`, `fetch_judgeme.py`, etc.) — add or remove without touching the rest. See [`templates/scripts/README.md`](templates/scripts/README.md) for the architecture.

## Common pitfalls

1. **Custom Pixel ≠ Web Pixel API.** `webPixelCreate` GraphQL requires App Extension which Custom Apps don't support. Tell the user to paste the Pixel via Settings → Customer events.
2. **App Embed Block toggles are merchant-only.** Even after API installs an App, the user must enable Embed Blocks in the Theme Editor manually. Provide the deep link: `https://admin.shopify.com/store/{store}/themes/{themeId}/editor?context=apps`.
3. **Clarity URL filter parameters are unreliable.** Don't construct `?Filter=...` URLs — give the base `/impressions` URL and tell the user to add filters in the UI.
4. **Free vs paid feature gates** — always tell the user upfront. Verify current pricing via `web_search` (see Hard Rule 2).
5. **Promise truthfulness** — only say "I'll do X" after confirming X is achievable via the plugin's skill chain.
6. **0 orders / 0 sessions ≠ broken pipeline.** When the report shows zeros, identify the structural cause (no custom domain / Shopify Payments not activated / no traffic source live / store < 2 weeks old) and hand off to the relevant sister skill (`shopify-store-optimizer` for domain + payments, `shopify-marketing-launch` for first traffic). Do NOT blame the data tooling, do NOT fake numbers, do NOT show empty `0/0/0` KPI tables daily — use the 0-order edge case template at the bottom of `templates/sample-report-mvp.md`.

## File structure & decision tree

The full file tree, a "where to find what" lookup table, and a decision tree for entering the flow at the right stage given partial install state — see [`references/01-skill-layout-and-decision-tree.md`](references/01-skill-layout-and-decision-tree.md).

When in doubt about which stage to start from, read that reference first.

## Success criteria — Hard verification gates

Main Agent selects the gates required by the original monitoring/reporting
request and decides completion from the corresponding evidence. For installation
only, use Reference 02's scoped theme acceptance instead; do not run the full
health check or require Data Export, a report, or a schedule. For a requested
monitoring setup, select only the requested data paths explicitly, for example
`python3 scripts/check_health.py --checks shopify clarity --config project/store-config.json`.
The required `--checks` accepts one or more of `shopify`, `clarity`, and
`judgeme`; there is no default full-stack run. Every selected path must succeed:
missing authorization, skipped/unavailable data and rate limits return failure,
not a healthy receipt. Omit unrequested providers instead of probing them.
This script does not inspect theme files, installation, loading or consent;
apply the corresponding scoped auditor gate below separately.

| # | Gate | How to verify |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Shopify Connector works | `shopify store execute --store {DOMAIN} --query '{ shop { name } }'` returns 200 with shop name |
| 2 | Clarity Data Export API works | `check_health.py --checks clarity` reuses `fetch_clarity.fetch_insights` and requires a successful response with ≥ 1 metric row. The existing fetcher owns Connector/token selection. An unavailable or rate-limited selected path remains unverified; omit this check when data access/reporting was not requested. |
| 3 | Judge.me metafields readable | `check_health.py --checks judgeme` reads `shop.metafields.judgeme.*` and requires a successful review count (0 is valid). Missing or unsynced metafields leave a requested data path unverified; omit Judge.me when it was not requested. |
| 4 | Theme renders the requested tracker | Decorator receipt identifies the implementation/read-back when a write was needed; the store auditor checks the exact intended theme's rendered provider ID, single loading and required consent behavior under Reference 02. Reuse a working existing integration; neither a particular snippet filename nor live publication is required for explicit preview-only delivery. |
| 5 | At least 1 report exists | `ls project/daily-reports/*.md` returns ≥ 1 file, size > 1KB |
| 6 | Cron is scheduled | After waiting 30s post-add, `cron list` shows job with `nextRunAtMs` < `now + 24h` |

### Report experience checks (when a report was requested)

- ✅ Report opens in any Markdown viewer without errors
- ✅ Every industry term has plain-language definition inline
- ✅ Report ends with a "single recommended action for today" — not a list of 10
- Aim to keep user-required setup time within 30 minutes; elapsed time alone does not invalidate verified delivery.

### Failure protocol

If a technical gate required for the original task fails:
1. Do NOT mark the skill complete
2. Report which gate failed + exact error
3. Offer remediation (re-auth via Connector / regenerate token / skip the failing tool and continue)
