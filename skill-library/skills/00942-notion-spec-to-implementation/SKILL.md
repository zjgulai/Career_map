# Spec to Implementation

Convert a Notion spec into linked implementation plans, tasks, and ongoing status updates.

## Quick start
1) Locate the spec with `Notion:search`, then fetch it with `Notion:fetch`.
2) Parse requirements and ambiguities using `reference/spec-parsing.md`.
3) Create a plan page with `Notion:notion-create-pages` (pick a template: quick vs. full).
4) Find the task database, confirm schema, then create tasks with `Notion:notion-create-pages`.
5) Link spec ↔ plan ↔ tasks; keep status current with `Notion:notion-update-page`.

## Tool-call guardrails
- Notion tool availability can vary by workspace. If a Notion MCP call returns `Tool <name> not found`, treat that tool as unavailable for the rest of the current task. Do not retry it with different arguments or call it again later; use `Notion:search` and `Notion:fetch` where sufficient.
- Use one literal search query per `Notion:search` call and include `filters: {}` when no narrower filter is needed. Run separate searches for alternate phrasings instead of putting `or` in a single query string.
- Only send Notion page, database, or data-source URLs/IDs to `Notion:fetch`; external connected-source search results are not fetch targets.
- Create plans and task pages with explicit `parent` and `pages` fields. For task databases, fetch first and use the returned `collection://...` data source ID.
- To append an implementation section to a spec, fetch the current section text first, then use `Notion:notion-update-page` with `command: "update_content"`, `properties: {}`, and exact `old_str` / `new_str` content. For property-only edits, use `command: "update_properties"` with `content_updates: []`; the current deployed schema expects both top-level fields even when one is unused.

## Workflow

### 0) If Notion tools are unavailable, pause and ask the user to connect the Notion app:
1. Enable the bundled Notion app for this plugin or session.
2. Complete the Notion auth flow if prompted.
3. Start a new session if the tools still do not appear.

After the app is connected, finish your answer and tell the user to retry so they can continue with Step 1.

### 1) Locate and read the spec
- Search first (`Notion:search`); if multiple hits, ask the user which to use.
- Fetch the page (`Notion:fetch`) and scan for requirements, acceptance criteria, constraints, and priorities. See `reference/spec-parsing.md` for extraction patterns.
- Capture gaps/assumptions in a clarifications block before proceeding.

### 2) Choose plan depth
- Simple change → use `reference/quick-implementation-plan.md`.
- Multi-phase feature/migration → use `reference/standard-implementation-plan.md`.
- Create the plan via `Notion:notion-create-pages`, include: overview, linked spec, requirements summary, phases, dependencies/risks, and success criteria. Link back to the spec.

### 3) Create tasks
- Find the task database (`Notion:search` → `Notion:fetch` to confirm the data source and required properties). Patterns in `reference/task-creation.md`.
- Size tasks to 1–2 days. Use `reference/ta[REDACTED].md` for content (context, objective, acceptance criteria, dependencies, resources).
- Set properties: title/action verb, status, priority, relations to spec + plan, due date/story points/assignee if provided.
- Create pages with `Notion:notion-create-pages` using the database’s `data_source_id`.

### 4) Link artifacts
- Plan links to spec; tasks link to both plan and spec.
- Optionally update the spec with a short “Implementation” section pointing to the plan and tasks using `Notion:notion-update-page`.

### 5) Track progress
- Use the cadence in `reference/progress-tracking.md`.
- Post updates with `reference/progress-update-template.md`; close phases with `reference/milestone-summary-template.md`.
- Keep checklists and status fields in plan/tasks in sync; note blockers and decisions.

## References and examples
- `reference/` — parsing patterns, plan/task templates, progress cadence (e.g., `spec-parsing.md`, `standard-implementation-plan.md`, `task-creation.md`, `progress-tracking.md`).
- `examples/` — end-to-end walkthroughs (e.g., `ui-component.md`, `api-feature.md`, `database-migration.md`).
