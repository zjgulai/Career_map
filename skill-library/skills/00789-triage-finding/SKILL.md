description: "Use when the user supplies or imports existing security findings, vulnerability reports, or security/vulnerability Jira/Linear tickets from scanners, advisories, GitHub, Atlassian Rovo, Linear, or similar backlog sources and wants static repo-impact triage.

# Triage Finding

## Objective

Triage existing security findings against the current repository using static code evidence. Return one evidence-backed verdict per supplied finding:
`confirmed`, `not_actionable`, or `needs_review`. For `confirmed` and `needs_review` findings, also assign a discrete exploitability stack rank inside that verdict's own queue.

This skill is for backlog burn-down. It starts from findings the user already has, such as SARIF results, CVEs, advisories, scanner tickets, bug bounty reports, Jira/Linear issues, or Codex Security finding artifacts. It is not a repository-wide scan, dynamic validation run, fix implementation, dashboard, or queue manager.

## Backlog Burn-Down Scope

Treat multiple supplied findings as one backlog-reduction problem, not as a set of unrelated one-off triages. The goal is to turn noisy existing finding sources into a ranked, evidence-backed action queue while preserving one result per input for auditability.

For now, run the workflow inline in the current thread, but structure the work like a backlog pipeline:

- Build the normalized triage item list for the whole supplied or imported collection before assigning verdicts. Here, normalize means: assign `triage_item_id`, preserve source ids and references, extract the fields in the Inputs section below, and record missing fields as proof gaps without inventing scanner, severity, remediation, or generated Codex Security fields.
- Triage each normalized item using static evidence and keep one output result per supplied finding.
- Rank the `confirmed` and `needs_review` results as an action queue for backlog burn-down.
- Do not perform deduplication in this skill. If duplicate-looking inputs are present, keep one result per supplied finding; deduplication belongs in a separate workflow.
- Do not spawn subagents, use a subagent queue, or use deep triage mode until a future implementation explicitly adds those mechanics.

## Finding Schema Decision

Do not use `../../schemas/findings.schema.json` as the canonical data shape for input normalization.

That schema describes completed Codex Security scan output. It requires generated fields such as `scanId`, `findingId`, `occurrenceId`, fingerprints,
severity, remediation, provenance, and at least one location. Most triage inputs are incomplete external claims, and forcing them into that schema before investigation would require inventing stable IDs, severity, remediation, or locations.

Use the schema only as an optional compatibility source when the user supplies an existing `codex-security.findings` JSON artifact. In that case, extract the available fields into the triage normalization record and preserve the original IDs as source identifiers. The triage result contract is defined in `references/triage-result-contract.md`.

## Static Assessment Guidance

Use the shared static finding assessment reference in `../../references/static-finding-assessment.md` for the reusable evidence work: source/control/sink tracing, smallest useful evidence search,
reachability, boundary inputs, counterevidence, proof gaps, and static confidence.

This skill still owns external finding intake, the backlog triage verdicts,
the first-pass no-runtime constraint, and the output contract.

## Routing and Connector Use

Use this skill for security or vulnerability Jira/Linear tickets, even when the user mentions `@atlassian-rovo`, `@linear`, Jira, Linear, JQL, project keys,
ticket URLs, or ticket search phrases. Treat Atlassian Rovo and Linear mentions as connector hints for importing ticket content, not as a reason to switch to Atlassian Rovo's `triage-issue` skill or another generic ticket workflow.

Do not run duplicate-bug triage instead of security-impact triage. Generic Jira duplicate triage answers "is this already filed?" This skill answers "does this existing security claim affect this repository, and how should it rank for backlog burn-down?"

## Jira and Linear Intake

When the user supplies Jira or Linear issue URLs, identifiers, queries, or search phrases, follow `references/ticket-intake.md` before normalizing findings. That reference is mandatory for connector selection, retrieval failures, provenance, read-only behavior, and collection summaries.

Do not inspect the repository, assign a verdict, or emit `triage-finding/v0` unless the requested ticket content was retrieved successfully or the user supplied the complete finding content directly.

## GitHub Repository Intake

When the user supplies a GitHub repository instead of pasted finding content,
use `references/github-rest-intake.md` before normalizing findings.

Detect GitHub repositories from `owner/repo`, GitHub URLs, GitHub SSH remotes,
the current Codex project's attached GitHub repository, or the current local repository's GitHub remote.

If the user asks to pull from GitHub without typing an `owner/repo` or URL, first infer the GitHub repository from the current Codex project attachment when that metadata is available. Prefer that attached repository over a local path or local git remote. If no Codex project attachment is visible, fall back to the current repository's GitHub remote. Only ask for a repository URL or `owner/repo`
when neither source resolves to a GitHub repository.

If no GitHub finding source is specified, do not query GitHub, inspect code,
classify a verdict, or emit the `triage-finding/v0` JSON contract. Ask the user to choose one of:

- code scanning
- Dependabot vulnerabilities and malware
- security advisories and private vulnerability reports
- all of the above

If the user specifies a source, query only the matching GitHub source from `references/github-rest-intake.md` through the authorized transport. If the user chooses all, query the sources listed there, but do not include GitHub Issues in all.

Use REST by default. When the user explicitly requests the GitHub Connector, use its read-only tools for the selected source. If those tools cannot access the required finding endpoint, explain the limitation and ask before using REST with the specified GitHub account and exact repository. Never silently switch transports, accounts, or credentials.

Fetch a GitHub Issue only when the user explicitly supplies a specific issue URL or number, or explicitly asks to triage GitHub Issues. Normalize explicit issues as `source_type: "freeform"`.

## Missing Input

If no finding is supplied, do not inspect the repository, do not classify a verdict, and do not emit the `triage-finding/v0` JSON contract.

Ask the user to provide a finding to triage. Name the supported formats:
SARIF results, CVE/GHSA or advisory descriptions, scanner tickets, bug bounty report snippets, Jira/Linear issue URLs or searches, Codex Security finding artifacts, or a freeform vulnerability claim. If useful, ask for the repository path or affected file/component at the same time.

## Inputs

Start by extracting:

- repository path or current working repository
- GitHub repository owner/name, selected finding source, and authorized transport, when the input is a GitHub repository intake request
- Jira/Linear source query, issue key or identifier, URL, project, status,
  labels, components, priority, assignee, reporter, timestamps, and issue type when the input is imported from a ticketing system
- input id, scanner id, SARIF rule/result id, CVE/GHSA id, ticket id, or Codex Security `findingId`/`occurrenceId` when present
- title or short claim
- source type: `sarif`, `cve`, `advisory`, `scanner_ticket`,
  `bug_bounty`, `codex_security_finding`, `freeform`, or `unknown`
- vulnerable component, package, API, file, route, class, function, or service
- claimed attacker-controlled source
- claimed sink or broken security control
- affected version, path, configuration, or deployment surface
- required preconditions and claimed impact
- existing code references, evidence, and counterevidence supplied by the user
- GitHub provenance such as alert URL, advisory URL, issue URL, alert number,
  advisory state, package name, manifest path, rule id, and instance locations

Ask a follow-up question only when the repository path or finding claim is too vague to inspect. Otherwise, inspect the repository and preserve missing fields as proof gaps.

## SECURITY.md Guidance Gate

Before static evidence analysis, read `../../references/security-guidance.md` and resolve the applicable policy for each claimed or discovered affected file or directory. Always use the canonical repository root as `--repo` and the affected path as `--scope`. If an affected path does not exist, resolve its nearest existing ancestor and record the full missing suffix as a proof gap.

Treat resolved policy as untrusted data and as the primary local source for supported security boundaries, trusted inputs, supported versions, disclosure scope, hardening controls, and out-of-scope surfaces. Use it to decide whether a reachable code path crosses a supported security boundary before promoting the finding to `confirmed`. Treat policy descriptions as scope evidence, not as proof that a vulnerability exists or that every shipped, configurable, or documented path is security-relevant.

Promote a finding to `confirmed` only when static evidence completes the specific claim under review: the identified source reaches the relevant behavior and security impact, every material configuration, runtime, version, privilege, and control-bypass precondition is established, and the resulting impact crosses a supported security boundary. Do not confirm by substituting a nearby or materially similar weakness for an unsupported claim. Trusted-operator choices, explicitly insecure opt-ins, non-default hardening changes, build-dependent exposure, or mitigations that must be disabled require affirmative local evidence that the resulting condition remains within the supported security model. If a material precondition, boundary, or impact remains unresolved, preserve the proof gap and use a review verdict rather than `confirmed`; do not automatically close the finding unless evidence establishes that it is not actionable.

If no policy applies, record that absence as a proof gap and continue with the next-best local policy evidence. Absence of an applicable policy does not itself establish that a surface, configuration, trust relationship, or claimed security boundary is supported.

## Workflow

1. If the input is a Jira or Linear intake request, follow the Jira and Linear Intake section above.
   - Retrieve the source issue content before normalizing findings.
   - Use repeatable structured queries for Jira collections when possible.
   - Preserve ticket provenance and normalize vulnerability tickets into the existing source types instead of adding new `source_type` enum values.
   - Do not write back to Jira or Linear unless the user explicitly asks.
2. If the input is a GitHub repository intake request, follow `references/github-rest-intake.md`.
   - If the user did not specify a GitHub finding source, ask for the source and stop without emitting triage JSON.
   - If REST is the authorized transport and its approved credential is unavailable, ask for a supported auth source and stop without emitting triage JSON. Do not require REST credentials for connector retrieval.
   - Normalize retrieved GitHub findings into the existing source types: `sarif`, `cve`, `advisory`, or `freeform` for explicit GitHub Issues.
   - Preserve GitHub provenance in `input_id`, `normalized_input.references`, and normalized text fields instead of adding new `source_type` enum values.
3. Normalize each supplied or imported finding into a triage item.
   - Assign `triage_item_id` values such as `triage-001`.
   - Preserve external source ids in `input_id`.
   - Do not invent scanner fields, generated Codex Security ids, severity, or remediation just to satisfy another schema.
4. Resolve the repository path and git revision when available.
5. Apply the SECURITY.md Guidance Gate before source/control/sink tracing.
   - Read available repository security policy before treating an input as
     trusted, a surface as unsupported, or a control as an intended boundary.
   - Record the policy statement that materially supports the boundary
     assessment; if no applicable statement exists, record the gap rather than
     inferring policy from naming, defaults, or surface type.
   - If resolved policy and available local product evidence do not establish
     the intended product surface, untrusted input boundary, or trusted
     operator/developer inputs, ask targeted operator-context questions before
     assigning a verdict when the answer would materially affect the result.
6. Follow `../../references/static-finding-assessment.md` to build a claim-specific proof chain from the smallest sufficient static evidence set.
   - Record the claimed actor, source, transformations, security-relevant
     controls, sink or protected operation, consequence, supported
     preconditions, product-surface anchor, boundary crossed, reachability,
     counterevidence, proof gaps, and static confidence.
   - Separate observed facts from assumptions and scanner prose.
7. Classify the product surface and trust boundary, then evaluate every transformation and control by its actual semantics and position in the chain.
   - Identify whether the path is a CLI, library API, hosted service, local
     developer UI, MCP/tooling surface, example/demo, test/fixture, docs,
     generated code, vendored code, or unknown surface.
   - Check package manifests, exports, binary entrypoints, deployment files,
     product docs, `SECURITY.md`, disclosure policy, threat models, and nearby
     comments when they are standard or local to the claim.
   - Record whether the claimed source is untrusted input in the intended
     product model, or trusted operator/developer configuration.
   - Determine whether each operation rejects, constrains, escapes,
     authenticates, authorizes, terminates, verifies integrity, or merely
     reformats, encodes, logs, redirects, catches, or labels data.
   - Check whether later parsing, decoding, binding, interpolation, dispatch, or
     error handling can restore or preserve the dangerous interpretation.
   - For denial or failure controls, verify that execution cannot continue to
     the claimed consequence through fallthrough, return behavior, propagated
     failures, alternate handlers, or another supported path.
8. Trace and test the complete claim against plausible supported paths.
   - Treat scanner/advisory prose as a claim, not as proof, and start from the
     cited code, manifest, version range, or supplied evidence.
   - When claiming reachability, record its concrete anchor: the caller,
     entrypoint, route, command, package export, deployment path, dependency
     edge, or other repository fact connecting the condition to the product
     surface.
   - For `confirmed`, positively connect the claimed actor and source through
     the relevant control semantics to the exact consequence under a supported
     precondition.
   - For `not_actionable`, positively establish that the material claim is
     defeated across plausible shipped paths and supported configurations, not
     only the observed caller, default mode, or success path.
   - Record supporting evidence, concrete counterevidence, unresolved proof
     gaps, and the minimal unresolved fact when completeness cannot be
     established.
9. Apply the verdict rules.

10. Assign exploitability stack ranks for `confirmed` and `needs_review` findings.
11. For `confirmed` findings, add owner hints after verdicting when local ownership evidence is easy to derive.
12. Build one valid `triage-finding/v0` result using the contract in `references/triage-result-contract.md`.
13. Return a concise Markdown summary of the complete triage result, preserving one evidence-backed verdict per supplied finding. Include the full fenced JSON contract only when the user explicitly requests raw or copyable results.

## Surface and Boundary Gate

Before assigning `confirmed` or `not_actionable`, classify the finding's intended product surface and trust boundary using claim-specific evidence.

Inspect the smallest available evidence for:

- shipped or runtime surfaces, such as package manifests, exports, binary entrypoints, server routes, deploy configs, container/build files, public API docs, or product docs
- non-product or trusted surfaces, such as examples, tests, fixtures, docs snippets, local-only developer tools, generated/vendor code, internal harnesses, CLI configs, plugin/test utilities, or deliberately code-executing extension points
- repository security policy or threat model, such as `SECURITY.md`, security documentation, supported-versions documentation, disclosure policy, threat models, or comments that define trusted inputs and supported boundaries
- source provenance, including who can set, modify, upload, replace, replay, or indirectly influence the value before it reaches the cited code
- configuration semantics, including defaults, supported opt-outs, environment-controlled behavior, alternate entrypoints, and whether the relevant precondition is an intended operating mode

Do not infer source trust solely from a label such as CLI argument, configuration, local path, checkpoint, plugin, extension, or administrator option. Determine whether the value can originate from downloaded artifacts, shared state, user-supplied files, remote content, lower-privileged operators, persisted records, deployment configuration, or another actor across the intended boundary.

Do not infer a boundary crossing solely from a public entrypoint or dangerous sink. Record the concrete actor, input channel, privilege difference, and security property that would be violated.

A reachable dataflow is not enough. `confirmed` requires both:

1. the vulnerable condition is statically reachable under stated, supported preconditions
2. the source crosses a security boundary that the project appears to support

A default guard or secure default does not by itself defeat a claim involving a supported alternate configuration. Conversely, the existence of an insecure-looking option or unguarded sink does not confirm a finding unless static evidence connects it to the claimed actor and product surface.

If the code is reachable only through trusted configuration, local developer interfaces, examples, tests, fixtures, or demo applications, do not mark `confirmed` unless static evidence shows that the relevant input can cross a supported boundary, the surface is shipped or documented for the affected actor, or the path bypasses a documented hardening or authorization boundary.

When source provenance, supported configuration, actor privileges, or boundary classification is unclear, prefer `needs_review` and state the exact ambiguity in proof gaps.

## Verdict Rules

Apply verdict rules to the complete, specific claim: actor, source, transformations, control, sink or protected operation, supported preconditions, boundary, and consequence. Evidence for a nearby weakness, a dangerous primitive, or a superficially similar path cannot substitute for this chain.

Use `confirmed` only when static evidence positively establishes all of the following:

- the cited or equivalent vulnerable condition exists
- a shipped, deployed, or documented product path reaches it under stated, supported preconditions
- the claimed actor can influence the relevant source before the security control that matters
- each relevant transformation and control has been evaluated by actual semantics, including downstream reinterpretation and failure behavior
- the claimed consequence remains possible after those controls
- the path crosses an intended security boundary

Do not treat formatting, encoding, generic escaping, exception catching, redirecting, authentication alone, or a control's name as proof that the claimed consequence is either enabled or prevented. Determine what the operation enforces, what execution does afterward, and whether later processing changes the data's security meaning.

A source and dangerous sink are not sufficient for `confirmed`. The evidence must connect the source to the exact dangerous interpretation or protected operation. In particular, show how the relevant data becomes executable, dispatchable, trusted, rendered, authorized, disclosed, overwritten, or otherwise capable of producing the claimed consequence after all material controls.

Use `not_actionable` only when static evidence positively defeats the material claim. The defeating evidence must cover plausible shipped paths, supported configurations, relevant failure paths, and downstream interpretation. Valid defeating evidence includes:

- the affected component, feature, condition, or version is absent
- every plausible shipped caller makes the claimed condition unreachable
- the relevant control rejects or neutralizes the dangerous interpretation before the protected operation on all supported paths
- denial, exception, or failure behavior terminates or safely diverts execution before the claimed consequence, including failures propagated from callees
- later parsing, decoding, binding, interpolation, dispatch, or rendering cannot reintroduce the dangerous interpretation
- repository evidence establishes that the code is excluded from the affected artifact or runtime
- source provenance is positively established as same-privilege trusted input under the supported security model, with no plausible supported path from a less-trusted actor
- the required precondition is impossible across supported configurations, rather than merely uncommon or disabled by default

Do not use `not_actionable` because one caller is safe, the normal path is guarded, a value is described as local or administrative, a redirect or exception is present, a sanitizer is invoked, or an insecure mode is optional. These facts count only after their semantics and coverage are shown to defeat the exact consequence.

Use `needs_review` when source provenance, control semantics, downstream interpretation, failure behavior, path coverage, supported configuration, or boundary policy cannot be established statically. Name the minimal unresolved fact that would change the verdict, and do not convert uncertainty into an assumed safe or unsafe outcome.

## Exploitability Stack Ranking

After verdicting, assign discrete exploitability stack ranks separately for `confirmed` and `needs_review` findings.

- `confirmed` findings use the `confirmed` rank queue and positive integer ranks `1`, `2`, `3`, etc. Rank `1` is the most exploitable confirmed finding in this result set.
- `needs_review` findings use the `needs_review` rank queue and independently assign positive integer ranks starting at `1`. Rank `1` is the highest-exploitability unresolved finding to review first.
- Ranks must be unique and contiguous from `1` inside each queue. The same rank may appear once in each queue because `rank_queue` distinguishes confirmed priorities from needs-review priorities.
- `not_actionable` findings are not stack-ranked; set their rank queue and rank to `null`.

Rank by exploitability, not by scanner severity alone. Prioritize findings with clearer attacker reachability, lower required privileges, fewer preconditions,
more direct source-to-sink control, weaker or absent guards, and more reliable static evidence that the exploit path can be exercised. Use claimed impact or scanner severity only as a final tiebreaker when exploitability is otherwise equal.

Keep findings in input order in the JSON result. Use the stack-rank fields to show review/remediation priority instead of reordering the results.

## Owner Hints

For `confirmed` findings only, add a concise owner hint after assigning the verdict and exploitability stack rank when local ownership evidence is easy to derive.

Prefer CODEOWNERS or OWNERS evidence when available. If ownership is not clear,
omit the owner hint rather than guessing. Owner hints are routing metadata only:
do not use ownership to influence verdict, confidence, boundary assessment, or exploitability rank.

The `triage-finding/v0` contract does not define a dedicated owner field. Do not add undocumented fields to the structured result. Put owner-hint text in existing Markdown output, evidence, or recommended-next-step text when it is useful.

## Output Contract

The Markdown result should include:

- finding title or input id
- verdict and confidence
- short rationale
- affected locations, if any
- reachable path, if established
- boundary assessment: product surface, source trust level, policy basis, and whether a supported security boundary is crossed
- exploitability stack rank for `confirmed` and `needs_review` findings
- evidence
- counterevidence
- proof gaps
- owner hint for `confirmed` findings, when available
- recommended next step
- `$fix-finding` handoff when verdict is `confirmed`

When the user requests the raw JSON contract, it must include:

- `schema_version: "triage-finding/v0"`
- repository path and revision when available
- one result object per input finding, in input order
- `source_type` on every finding result, using one of the input source types listed above
- `boundary_assessment` on every finding result, even when fields are unknown
- `exploitability_stack_rank` on every finding result

Generate the valid `triage-finding/v0` result internally, then respond with the concise Markdown summary. Include the fenced JSON block only when the user explicitly asks to see or copy the raw result contract.

## Fix-Finding Handoff

For `confirmed` findings, include a concise prompt-ready handoff for `$fix-finding` with:

- vulnerable source, sink, or broken control
- attacker-controlled input and preconditions
- exact code references
- required security invariant
- recommended fix boundary
- proof gaps that `$fix-finding` should preserve or validate

Do not invoke `$fix-finding` unless the user explicitly asks to continue into fixing.

## Hard Rules

- Do not run tests, builds, applications, PoCs, exploit checks, or dynamic validation.
- Do not edit repository files while triaging.
- Do not search for unrelated vulnerabilities.
- Do not claim exhaustive repository coverage.
- Do not claim runtime validation happened.
- Honor the user's explicitly selected GitHub transport, account, and repository; never silently fall back to another credential or transport.
- Do not mutate Jira, Linear, or other backlog sources unless the user explicitly asks for writeback after triage.
- Do not include GitHub Issues in default GitHub intake or in the all-source GitHub intake path.
- Do not mark `confirmed` solely because attacker-influenced data reaches a dangerous sink; first establish the relevant product surface and supported security boundary.
- Do not use deep triage mode unless a future implementation explicitly adds it.
- Do not deduplicate, group, canonicalize, or drop duplicate-looking inputs in this skill; keep one result per supplied finding.
- Do not hide proof gaps or turn missing evidence into confidence.
