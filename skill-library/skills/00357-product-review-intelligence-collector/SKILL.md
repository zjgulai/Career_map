# Product Review Intelligence Collector

## Overview

This skill transforms raw customer feedback from e-commerce platforms into actionable market intelligence. Instead of just "listing" reviews, it focuses on **automated collection** and **strategic synthesis** to help product managers and researchers identify market gaps, competitive advantages, and customer pain points.

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Target Identification & Scoping
1.  **Identify Platforms**: Determine where the target audience leaves the most honest feedback (e.g., Amazon for utility, TikTok for trends, Specialized forums for enthusiasts).
2.  **Define Scope**: 
    *   **Direct Competitors**: Top-selling ASINs or URLs.
    *   **Quantity**: Determine the sample size (e.g., "latest 50 reviews" or "all 1-3 star reviews from the last 6 months").
    *   **Segments**: Focus on specific variations (colors, sizes) if relevant.

### Step 2: Collection Strategy
Use the most efficient tool based on the platform:
- **Amazon**: Prefer `apify` actors (like `junglee/amazon-reviews-scraper`) or `browser` sessions for authenticated/localized results.
- **Social Media (TikTok/Instagram)**: Use `browser` to scroll comments or `apify` social media scrapers.
- **Generic Sites**: Use `web_fetch` for static pages or `browser` for JS-heavy review widgets.

### Step 3: Data Extraction & Cleaning
For each review, extract:
- **Metadata**: Star rating, Date, Verified Purchase status, Helpful votes.
- **Content**: Review title and body text.
- **Rich Media**: Note if photos or videos are attached (indicates high engagement).
- **Cleaning**: Filter out "vine customer reviews" (incentivized) or one-word reviews (e.g., "Good") to focus on high-signal content.

### Step 4: Multi-Dimensional Analysis
Analyze the collected data across these 4 dimensions:
1.  **Pros (High-Value Hooks)**: What do users love? (e.g., "The handle stays cool in the microwave").
2.  **Cons (Critical Flaws)**: What are the recurring complaints? (e.g., "The bottom is not flat, it wobbles").
3.  **Scenario Mapping**: Where and how are they using it? (e.g., "Used in a camper van," "Office desk companion").
4.  **Unmet Needs**: What do users wish the product had? (e.g., "Wish it came with a lid").

## Deliverable Formats

### 1. Raw Data (`reviews_ASIN.json`)
Store structured data for further processing:
```json
[
  {
    "rating": 5,
    "title": "Best mug ever",
    "text": "...",
    "is_verified": true,
    "has_images": true,
    "date": "2024-03-15"
  }
]
```

### 2. Intelligence Report (`review_analysis_report.md`)
ALWAYS include a summary table and a "Product Opportunity" section:
# [Product Name] Review Analysis
## Executive Summary
- **Overall Sentiment**: Positive/Mixed/Negative
- **Key Pivot Point**: The one thing that defines this product's success or failure.

## Deep Dive Analysis
- **Top 3 Pros**: ...
- **Top 3 Cons**: ...
- **Common Use Scenarios**: ...

## Market Gaps & Opportunities
- [Insight 1]: "Users complain about X; a version with Y would dominate."
- [Insight 2]: "Scenario Z is underserved by current designs."

## Best Practices
- **Focus on the "Middle"**: 3-star reviews often contain the most balanced and detailed technical feedback.
- **Watch the Velocity**: A sudden spike in negative reviews often points to a recent manufacturing/QC issue.
- **Analyze Images**: Users often post photos of broken parts; these are "smoking guns" for product improvement.
