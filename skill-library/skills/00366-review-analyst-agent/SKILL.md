# Review Analyst Agent

Analyze product reviews to find issues and prioritize improvements.

**This skill uses 4 specialized agents** that analyze reviews from different angles, then synthesizes into actionable recommendations.

## What It Produces

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sentiment Overview** | Overall sentiment breakdown (positive/neutral/negative) |
| **Top Complaints** | Prioritized list of issues by frequency and severity |
| **Top Praise** | What customers love (to protect/emphasize) |
| **Feature Requests** | What customers want that doesn't exist |
| **Priority Matrix** | Critical/Important/Nice-to-have improvements |
| **Action Plan** | Specific recommendations with expected impact |

## Prerequisites

- Web access for scraping reviews
- No API keys required

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Product and Sources (REQUIRED)

⚠️ **DO NOT skip this step. Use interactive questioning — ask ONE question at a time.**

#### Question Flow

⚠️ **Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool for each question below.** Do not just print questions in your response — use the tool to create interactive prompts with the options shown.

**Q1: Product**
> "I'll analyze reviews for your product! First — **what's the product?**
> 
> *(Product name or URL)*"

*Wait for response.*

**Q2: Sources**
> "**Where should I look** for reviews?
> 
> - Amazon
> - App Store / Google Play
> - G2 / Capterra
> - Reddit
> - All of the above
> - Or specify"

*Wait for response.*

**Q3: Context**
> "Is this **your product** or a **competitor's**?
> 
> *(Helps frame the analysis)*"

*Wait for response.*

**Q4: Issues**
> "Any **known issues** you want me to validate or explore?
> 
> - Yes — describe them
> - No — find all issues"

*Wait for response.*

#### Quick Reference

| Question | Determines |
|----------|------------|
| Product | What to analyze |
| Sources | Where to scrape reviews |
| Context | Framing of recommendations |
| Issues | Focus areas for analysis |

### Step 2: Collect Reviews

Use browser tools to scrape reviews from:

| Source Type | Platforms |
|-------------|-----------|
| **E-commerce** | Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy |
| **Software** | G2, Capterra, TrustRadius, Product Hunt |
| **Apps** | App Store, Google Play Store |
| **General** | Trustpilot, BBB, Yelp |
| **Social** | Reddit, Twitter/X, YouTube comments |
| **Forums** | Product-specific communities |

**Collect for each review:**
- Rating (if available)
- Date
- Review text
- Helpful votes (if available)

---

### Step 3: Run Specialized Analysis Agents in Parallel

Deploy 4 agents, each analyzing from a different perspective:

#### Agent 1: Review Scraper
Focus: Find and collect reviews from multiple sources
```
Tasks:
- Navigate to review platforms
- Extract review text and ratings
- Collect metadata (date, helpful votes)
- Handle pagination
- De-duplicate reviews
```

#### Agent 2: Sentiment Analyzer
Focus: Analyze sentiment and emotional patterns
```
Analyze:
- Overall sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
- Emotional intensity
- Frustration indicators
- Satisfaction indicators
- Sentiment trends over time
```

#### Agent 3: Issue Identifier
Focus: Categorize complaints and find patterns
```
Identify:
- Common complaint themes
- Frequency of each issue
- Severity indicators
- Specific quotes as evidence
- Root cause patterns
```

#### Agent 4: Improvement Recommender
Focus: Prioritize and recommend fixes
```
Recommend:
- Priority ranking of issues
- Specific improvement suggestions
- Expected impact of each fix
- Quick wins vs long-term investments
- Competitive gaps to address
```

### Step 4: Synthesize into Analysis Report

Combine all agent outputs into a structured report:
