# Returns & Exchange Automator

## Overview

A robust returns and exchange system transforms a potential point of friction into a customer retention engine. In modern ecommerce, the goal is to provide a "Self-Service" experience that minimizes support tickets while protecting the business from fraud. This skill covers the technical automation of Return Merchandise Authorizations (RMAs), label generation, and the logic of "Resolution" (Refund vs. Exchange vs. Store Credit).

## The Return Resolution Logic

| Resolution | Cost to Business | Retention Value | Best For |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Refund to Original Payment** | High (Cash Out + Processing Fee) | Low | Defective items, First-time buyer dissatisfaction. |
| **Store Credit** | Low (Cash stays in business) | High | "Changed mind," Sizing issues. |
| **Direct Exchange** | Medium (Shipping costs) | Very High | Sizing issues, Color preference. |
| **"Keep It" (No Return)** | Variable (Product COGS) | High | Low-value items where return shipping > product value. |

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Self-Service RMA Portal Setup

Avoid manual email threads by implementing a portal where customers can enter their Order # and Email/Zip to initiate a return.

#### Shopify Admin
1.  **Native Returns:** Navigate to **Settings > Returns**. Enable "Self-service returns."
2.  **Return Rules:** Set your window (e.g., 30 days from delivery). 
3.  **Final Sale:** Use product tags (e.g., `final-sale`) to automatically exclude specific items from the returns portal.

#### WooCommerce Admin
1.  Enable "Customer Account" pages. Use a dedicated "Request Warranty/Return" endpoint.
2.  **Status Sync:** Ensure that when a return is requested, the order status moves to "On Hold" or "RMA Pending" to prevent double-refunding.

### Step 2: Automated Label Generation (API)

Standardize on "Prepaid Labels" to control carrier choice and track the return journey.

#### Technical Implementation (Generic Carrier API)
```typescript
import { createShipment } from './carrier-api';

// Create a return label (charged on scan)
async function generateReturnLabel(orderId: string, customerAddress: any) {
  const returnLabel = await createShipment({
    from_address: customerAddress,
    to_address: process.env.WAREHOUSE_ADDRESS,
    is_return: true,
    carrier: 'USPS',
    service_level: 'priority_mail'
  });

  return {
    tracking_url: returnLabel.tracking_url,
    label_pdf: returnLabel.label_url
  };
}
```

### Step 3: Inspection & Restocking Logic

Never auto-restock items without a physical inspection. 

1.  **The Quarantine Bin:** All returns should be scanned into a "Quarantine" location in your Warehouse Management System (WMS).
2.  **Inspection Checklist:**
    - Is the item in original packaging?
    - Are tags attached?
    - Is there evidence of "Wardrobing" (wear and tear)?
3.  **Resolution Trigger:** Only after the "Pass" scan should the API trigger the `issue_refund` or `issue_store_credit` call to the ecommerce platform.

### Step 4: Mitigating Return Fraud

- **Empty Box Detection:** Weigh the return package at the carrier intake. If the weight is >20% lower than the outbound shipment, flag for manual audit.
- **Serial Number Matching:** For high-value electronics, store serial numbers at outbound fulfillment and verify them during the return inspection.
- **Return Velocity Limits:** Flag customers who have a return rate > 50% over a 90-day period for "Account Review."

## Benchmarks & Performance Targets

| Metric | Benchmark (Healthy) | Target (Elite) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Return Rate (General)** | 5% - 15% | < 3% |
| **Return Rate (Apparel)** | 20% - 35% | < 15% |
| **Exchange Rate** | 10% of Returns | > 25% of Returns |
| **Processing Time** | 3-5 Days from Receipt | < 24 Hours |

## Troubleshooting & Edge Cases

- **International Returns:** Customs duties often cannot be recovered easily. Consider a "Refund without Return" policy for international orders under $50 to save on cross-border logistics costs.
- **"Damaged in Transit":** Require a photo upload in the RMA portal before the label is generated. This creates a paper trail for carrier insurance claims.
- **Return Shipping Costs:** Decide on "Free Returns" vs. "Flat Fee." A $7.95 "Restocking/Label Fee" deducted from the refund is a common way to recover reverse logistics costs without deterring genuine returns.
- **Gift Returns:** Allow the recipient to return for "Store Credit" only, preventing the refund from going back to the original buyer's card (which would spoil the surprise).
