# Calculate and Act on Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

## Overview

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) represents the total net revenue a customer is expected to generate throughout their entire relationship with your store. Understanding CLV allows for data-driven decisions on acquisition spend (CAC), retention investment, and tiered loyalty programming.

## When to Use This Skill

- When setting acquisition cost (CAC) targets for marketing channels.
- When identifying high-value customers for a VIP or referral program.
- When predicting customer churn to trigger automated win-back sequences.
- When evaluating the long-term ROI of specific products or categories.
- When calculating the payback period of newly acquired customers.

## Core Instructions

### Step 1: Historical vs. Predictive CLV

*   **Historical CLV:** The sum of all actual revenue from a customer to date. (Sum of all orders minus refunds/cancellations).
*   **Predictive CLV:** An estimate of future revenue based on historical behavior (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value).

#### Mathematical Formula (Simple Parametric):
`CLV = (Average Order Value) × (Average Order Frequency per Year) × (Average Customer Lifespan in Years) × (Gross Margin Rate)`

*   **Example Calculation:**
    *   AOV = $100
    *   Frequency = 4 times/year
    *   Lifespan = 3 years
    *   Margin = 50%
    *   **CLV** = $100 × 4 × 3 × 0.50 = **$600**

### Step 2: Accessing Platform Data

#### Shopify
1.  **Direct View:** Go to **Admin → Analytics → Reports → Customers**.
2.  **Export:** Go to **Customers → Export** to get a CSV containing `Total Spent` and `Number of Orders` for every customer.
3.  **Third-Party Tools:** Apps like **Lifetimely** or **Triple Whale** provide more granular CLV curves and cohort analysis, but the raw data is natively available via Shopify Admin.

#### WooCommerce & BigCommerce
1.  Use the platform's built-in **Analytics → Customers** reports to view lifetime spend and order history.
2.  Filter by date to view CLV for specific acquisition cohorts.
3.  Analytics tools like **Metorik** are commonly used to provide more advanced retention and churn reporting.

### Step 3: Predictive Segmentation (Automated Flows)

Create dynamic segments to target different customer value tiers:

#### VIP Recognition Sequence
*   **Trigger Segment:** Historical CLV > $500 OR Total Orders > 5.
*   **Automation:** When a customer enters this segment, send a personalized "VIP Welcome" email.
*   **Action:** Offer early access to sales, exclusive products, or a dedicated customer success contact.

#### Win-Back Flow for At-Risk High-Value Customers
*   **Trigger Segment:** CLV > $200 AND Last Order Date > 90 days ago.
*   **Automation:**
    *   **Day 0:** Personalized "We miss you" email with recommendations based on prior purchases.
    *   **Day 7:** Email with a small incentive (e.g., Free Shipping or 10% off).
    *   **Day 14:** Final "founder-style" outreach.

### Step 4: Decision Criteria & Deepening

#### CLV by Acquisition Channel Calculation
Calculate the average CLV for customers acquired from Facebook vs. Google vs. Email:
1.  Export your customer list with **Total Spent** and **First UTM Source**.
2.  Group by source and average the spent.
3.  *Decision:* If Facebook CLV is $50 and Google CLV is $120, shift budget from Facebook to Google even if Facebook's initial CAC is lower.

#### Setting CAC Targets from CLV
Use the **3:1 LTV/CAC Ratio** as a benchmark:
*   `Target CAC = (Predicted CLV × Gross Margin) / 3`
*   *Example:* If your margin-adjusted CLV is $300, you can spend up to $100 to acquire a new customer and remain profitable.

#### Payback Period Calculation
The time it takes for a customer to become profitable after acquisition.
*   `Payback Period = CAC / (AOV × Gross Margin)`
*   *Strategy:* If the payback period is >12 months, your business is "cash-flow negative" on acquisition; you must focus on increasing AOV or initial conversion rate.

## Best Practices

- **Filter Out Noise:** Always exclude cancelled, refunded, and fraudulent orders from CLV calculations to avoid overstating value.
- **Segment by Product Category:** Identify which "entry product" leads to the highest CLV. Promote these products in top-of-funnel ads.
- **Refresh Quarterly:** Predictive models should be updated every 3 months as market conditions and customer behavior shift.
- **Focus on the Median:** Single-order outliers (e.g., a massive B2B order) can skew average CLV. Use **Median CLV** for a more realistic view of the typical customer.

## Common Pitfalls

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Overspending on CAC | Ensure your CAC targets are based on *Margin-adjusted CLV*, not just Top-line Revenue. |
| Win-Back too early | A "churn" signal varies by product. Coffee (30 days) vs. Furniture (2 years). Align win-back triggers to your typical purchase cycle. |
| Ignoring early churn | If 80% of customers never make a second purchase, focus on **post-purchase experience** before scaling acquisition spend. |
| Stale Segments | Static lists fail. Always use **Dynamic Segments** that automatically add/remove customers based on their real-time behavior. |
