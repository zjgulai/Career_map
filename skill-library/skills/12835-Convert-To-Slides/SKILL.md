# Convert To Slides

Create a polished PowerPoint or Google Slides deck from an existing Data app.

## Overall Instructions

- Follow the [shared Data instructions](../../shared/shared-skill-instructions.md) throughout this workflow.
- When converting a Data report or dashboard to slides, follow the [Data App Contract](../../shared/data-app.md) for source preservation and export.

## Dependencies

Apply the shared [dependency resolution policy](../../shared/shared-skill-instructions.md#dependency-resolution) to the categories below.

- Knowledge & Files: Source artifacts, slide templates, audience context, and requested cloud-presentation destinations.

## Route

- For a local app, use its `dist/index.html` and `src/data.json` directly.
- For a published app, use its exact HTTPS `.chatgpt.site` or `.chatgpt-team.site` URL, the reviewed snapshot from `/api/snapshot`, and the saved presentation state from `/api/presentation` as the equivalent verified source. Follow [Published Site authentication](../../shared/data-app.md#published-site-authentication) before declaring a `401` blocked.
- Preserve its visible content, charts, filters, presentation state, and reviewed source data. Do not create an intermediate report or rebuild the app.
- Create a PPTX file with the [@presentations](plugin://presentations@openai-primary-runtime) plugin and match the final output format to the request.

## Workflow

1. **Preflight capabilities.** Confirm that the canonical Presentations skill is available before conversion. For native Google Slides, also confirm Google Drive presentation import or supported native image insertion. If a required capability is unavailable, explain the blocker and retain any verified local PPTX; do not claim delivery to Google Slides.
2. **Resolve the existing app.** For a local app, verify its `dist/index.html` and use `src/data.json`. For a published app, verify the exact HTTPS `.chatgpt.site` or `.chatgpt-team.site` source URL, load the compiled app from that URL, and fetch its reviewed snapshot and saved presentation state from the source origin's `/api/snapshot` and `/api/presentation` endpoints. Reject other remote sources or a hosted source whose app, snapshot, or presentation endpoint cannot be read. Use the resolved app, presentation state, and referenced evidence to preserve visible content, charts, filters, claims, definitions, caveats, freshness, and provenance.
3. **Determine a starting style.** If a template or reference wasn't already provided, ask the user if they have a preference on what to base the slides layout and style on. If strong candidates exist in memory or user context, be helpful and suggest them (include a link). If none exist, use the `artifact-template-simple-light-mode` skill from the `openai-templates` plugin.
4. **Author with the Presentations plugin.** Read and follow the canonical Presentations skill. Adapt the existing app's visible content into clear slides while preserving its headings, chart order, and presentation state. Do not invent an executive summary, recommendations, or next steps that are absent from the app. If using a template, do not alter the layout of the slides unless explicitly asked to by the user. Copy template slide layouts as you need them and only delete the blanks when you are done.
5. **Capture charts and preserve structure.** Use the chart-image workflow below to capture the app's rendered cards as PNGs and embed those files directly. Reconstruct a chart only under the shared last-resort capture fallback, with verified reviewed data, and report that fallback only in the final response to the user. Preserve signed values, units, definitions, caveats, source labels, and freshness. Carry the measured population, grain, and coverage into slide labels and explanatory text; a metric measured for a subset must not be labeled as covering the whole population. Keep surrounding text, tables, and shapes editable; never use a whole-app screenshot.
6. **Render, inspect, and repair.** Inspect every slide at full size and run the canonical overflow test. Fix clipping, overlap, unreadable labels, missing chart marks, unresolved placeholders, and low-contrast surfaces. Tighten copy before shrinking fonts.
7. **Validate and deliver.** Confirm the PPTX opens cleanly and contains the required claims, metrics, caveats, freshness, and provenance. For Google Slides, import the verified PPTX. If import is blocked but native image insertion is supported, use the same PNGs with native slide text as described in the shared workflow. Read back image counts and inspect the rendered slides before returning the link; report an import failure separately from a successful native insertion.

## Chart images

- For chart images, prefer the open Data app's read-only WebMCP tools: discover exact IDs with `list_data_app_cards({})`, then use `get_data_app_card_image({ cardId, scale: 3 })` or `get_data_app_card_images({ cardIds, scale: 3 })`. Read [Card images for slides and documents](../../shared/data-app.md#card-images-for-slides-and-documents) for browser discovery, PNG decoding, scope checks, and capture limits. Pass the saved PNG files to the Presentations plugin; do not print base64 image bytes.
- Follow the shared [capture priority](../../shared/data-app.md#capture-priority) and [image-preservation workflow](../../shared/data-app.md#preserve-chart-images-across-non-pdf-exports), including native Download PNG, same-card capture, and connector image insertion. Rebuild from existing reviewed data only after all three capture paths fail or are unavailable; validate the result and report the capture blockers and recreated charts only in the final response to the user. Styling, generic editable-deck requirements, or import/MIME failures alone must not trigger reconstruction.
- Card captures include rendered titles and text. Avoid duplicating those headings; keep surrounding captions, caveats, and source notes editable. Preserve the original image even when the deck uses a different template.
- Preserve aspect ratio and fit the whole image without cropping. Use the returned pixel dimensions to size placement at roughly 200 pixels per inch or better. Prefer scale 3 for card captures; if size limits require a lower scale, recheck legibility rather than enlarging a low-resolution image. Inspect every embedded chart at full size for sharp text, complete marks, accurate colors, and the intended filters and local chart selections.

## Hard gates

- The Presentations plugin was selected and available before conversion.
- Either the local app's verified `dist/index.html` and reviewed `src/data.json`, or the published app's verified HTTPS `.chatgpt.site` or `.chatgpt-team.site` URL with successful `/api/snapshot` and `/api/presentation` responses, was used directly as the reference for slides.
- Every slide passes full-slide visual inspection and overflow checks.
- Charts use the app's exported PNGs or the validated last-resort capture fallback, reported only in the final response; all match its selected view, including signs and units.
- The deck contains native, editable surrounding structure with embedded chart images and faithfully presents the existing app's content.
- The delivered destination matches the request.

If a hard gate fails, stop and report the failure.
