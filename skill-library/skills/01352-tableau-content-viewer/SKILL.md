description: Show, open, or render an existing Tableau view, dashboard, or workbook live via open_in_codex, by name or keyword — for "show me/open/pull up this dashboard/view" requests. Do not use to query or analyze the data behind it or to create/edit/publish a workbook (tableau-workbook-authoring).

# Purpose

Find a specific Tableau view (or workbook) and render it live via `open_in_codex`. Never touches a `.twb` file.

# Routing

- Find the content → `search-content` — see [`../../references/search.md`](../../references/search.md) for the call shape and how to disambiguate multiple matches. Reuse an already-resolved LUID/URL instead of searching again for the same content.
- Get a render-ready URL → `get-view` (resolved `luid` as `viewId`) or `get-workbook` (as `workbookId`, only when no specific view matched). `search-content` never returns a URL — this call is required.
- Render → `render-interactive-viz` with the resolved `luid` and matching `objectType`. If unavailable, call `open_in_codex` with the direct URL — see [`../../references/rendering.md`](../../references/rendering.md).

# Requirements

- Prefer a view result when the user asked for a view; a workbook-only match is fine only when the user asked for the workbook as a whole.
- Don't fabricate a view/workbook name or URL the search tools didn't surface.
- A missing `render-interactive-viz`/search/content tool usually means a site admin disabled its group (`mcp-apps`/`EXCLUDE_TOOLS`) — that's site config, not a bug.
- If the `download-workbook` tool returns a temporary URL, download the file locally
