name: pptx-swarm
description:  Exclusive skill for generating PowerPoint/PPT/PPTX presentations. Any request involving creating, generating, producing, designing, or laying out slides or presentations **must** use the domain-specific language provided by a PPTD-family skill; using python-pptx, OpenXML SDK, or any other library/method to generate presentations is strictly prohibited. Use this `pptx-swarm` skill only for long presentation generation or batch creation of multiple presentations; otherwise use the `pptx` skill. This skill does not support editing, modifying, reading, or reverse-converting existing PPT/PPTX files; if the user asks to modify an existing PPT, use another approach.\nThe main agent must complete visual design, outline design, and .pptd file construction. Sub-agents may only generate .page files. Before the .pptd file is generated, strictly prohibited from assigning production tasks to sub-agents using the `agent` tool or any other tool!

# Definition
The pptx skill is responsible for generating and creating PPTX presentations. This skill defines an intermediate layer (with the .pptd extension) that further abstracts OOXML, making presentation generation effortless.

# .pptd Format
- The .pptd format is a simplified abstraction layer over OOXML, based on YAML syntax, designed specifically for AI to read and write presentations. This abstraction retains the core content of OOXML (themes, page layouts, element positions and definitions, etc.) while removing complex nested logic such as Masters, making each page self-contained and WYSIWYG.
- Usage: Follow the instructions below and use the CLI tools to convert .pptd files into .pptx files. Users can then open the .pptx file directly.
- Read format/pptd.md for the detailed definition of the .pptd format.

# PPTX Generation
When the user requests: creating a PPT / converting a document to PPT / recreating an image or website as a PPT / creating a PPT in a reference style, read guideline/generate_slides.md for more guidance.

# PPTX Delivery
After the PPTD presentation is complete, you **must** use the built-in checker to verify the file and ensure there are no format errors or unexpected overflow issues. After all issues are fixed, the main agent can use the following CLI command to convert the .pptd file into a .pptx file and deliver it to the user:

```bash
scripts/convert.sh input.pptd -o output.pptx
```

**Note: Since sub-agents usually only work on part of the .page files, the project is incomplete at that stage. Therefore, only the main agent may run the conversion command after all .page files have been created and checked. It is strictly prohibited to convert and deliver the file immediately after a sub-agent completes only part of the .page files!**

# ATTENTION

## Basic Guidelines
1. Scope of operations: Directly operating on .pptx files is strictly prohibited. All your operations should apply to .pptd files, then use the CLI tools to convert .pptd to .pptx.
2. File dependency awareness: .pptd files depend on sibling resources such as `pages/`, `images/` under the same directory, so **copying or moving the .pptd file alone is strictly prohibited**. If relocation is required, the entire directory must be migrated together — otherwise the CLI conversion tool will fail.
3. Parallel tool calls: If you need to make multiple consecutive tool calls (e.g., generating multiple .page files in sequence; making multiple edit tool calls to modify different locations in the same file, etc.), you should make multiple parallel tool calls in a single output, rather than making separate thinking-toolcall, thinking-toolcall rounds. This avoids context redundancy caused by multiple rounds of output.
4. When the user requests creating multiple presentations, **you must adopt a generate-all-first, then check-one-by-one strategy!** That is: serially complete the creation or modification of each PPT (including .page files and .pptd files), and only proceed to unified checking, fixing, and delivery after all presentations are created. **Never complete one PPT and immediately check, fix, and deliver it before creating the next PPT**.
