description: "Yuandian Law (元典法律数据库), a Chinese (mainland-PRC) legal database covering statutes, regulations, and court cases. Provides semantic and keyword search plus detail lookup — over laws/regulations across all effect levels (the Constitution, national laws, judicial interpretations, administrative regulations, departmental rules, etc.) and over both ordinary and authoritative cases — with multi-dimensional filters (effect level, effectiveness status, court, administrative region, case category, date, etc.). Suitable for legal case analysis, legal consultation, legal research, and compliance analysis."

# Yuandian Law

Use this skill to answer questions that require Yuandian Law legal database data.

## Setup

Check whether the agent-gw Python SDK is available in the current Python environment, and install it only if the check fails:

```bash
python3 -c "import agent_gw" || python3 -m pip install "$(curl -s https://cdn.kimi.com/agentgw/pysdk/manifest.json | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['latest']['url'])")"
```

The SDK needs an API key from `[REDACTED]`, `KIMI_API_KEY`, or
`~/.kimi/agent-gw.json`.

## Workflow

1. Run `python3 scripts/yuandian_law_tool.py describe` from the plugin directory to
   call `get_data_source_desc({"name": "yuandian_law"})`.
2. Read the returned Markdown carefully. It contains the overall data source
   rules, legal-domain formats, global constraints, and each API's description,
   required parameters, optional parameters, defaults, and allowed values.
3. Select the API that best matches the user's question, such as semantic search,
   keyword search, or detail lookup for laws, regulations, or cases.
4. Build `params` exactly from the Markdown requirements. Use documented filters
   such as effect level, effectiveness status, court, administrative region, case
   category, and date only when the API supports them.
5. Use `python3 scripts/yuandian_law_tool.py call` to call
   `call_data_source_tool`.
6. If the call fails, explain the failure reason from the response.
7. If the call succeeds, save any returned files first, then answer using
   `resp.result.assistant`; ignore `resp.result.user` unless display content is
   specifically needed.

## Script

Use the bundled script from the plugin directory:

```bash
python3 scripts/yuandian_law_tool.py describe
```

After reading the Markdown and selecting an API:

```bash
python3 scripts/yuandian_law_tool.py call \
  --api-name "<api name from markdown>" \
  --params-json '{"required_param":"value"}'
```

For larger params, write a JSON object and pass
`--params-file path/to/params.json`.

The script:

- sends `{"name": "yuandian_law"}` to `get_data_source_desc`
- sends `{"data_source_name": "yuandian_law", "api_name": ..., "params": ...}` to
  `call_data_source_tool`
- prints failure messages from `error.user` or `error.assistant`
- saves returned files to each `files[].name` path returned by the data source
- prints the joined `result.assistant` texts on success

Expected `call_data_source_tool` response shape:

```python
{
    "is_success": bool,
    "result": {"user": list[str], "assistant": list[str]} | None,
    "error": {"user": list[str], "assistant": list[str]} | None,
    "files": [{"name": str, "content": str}],
}
```

When files are returned, `name` is the file path or name to write. The path is
usually dictated by the selected API's params in the Markdown docs. If an API
does not need files, the response normally has no files to save.
