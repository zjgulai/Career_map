# Referral Program Builder

## Overview

A referral program transforms your customer base into a high-efficiency acquisition channel. By incentivizing existing customers (Referrers) to introduce new ones (Referees), brands can achieve a lower Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and higher Customer Lifetime Value (LTV). This skill covers the technical architecture of unique link generation, double-sided reward logic, and fraud mitigation.

## The Referral Logic Framework

| Component | Definition | Strategy |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **The Trigger** | When the referral is invited. | Post-purchase (Honeymoon phase) or Account Dashboard. |
| **The Incentive** | The "Give X, Get Y" offer. | Double-sided (both parties benefit) is the industry standard. |
| **The Attribution** | Tracking the conversion. | Cookie-based (30 days) or Coupon-code based. |
| **The Reward** | The payout mechanism. | Store credit, Discount code, or Physical gift. |

### Decision Criteria: Reward Type

- **Store Credit ($):** Best for high-frequency categories (Supplements, Coffee). Encourages a second purchase.
- **Percentage Off (%):** Best for high-ticket items (Furniture, Electronics) where the absolute dollar value of a % discount is significant.
- **Physical Gift:** Best for luxury or niche brands where "Exclusivity" is more valuable than cash.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Unique Link & Code Generation

Every customer needs a persistent, unique identifier to track their referrals.

#### Technical Implementation (Custom/Headless)
```typescript
// Generate a unique, human-friendly referral code per customer
export async function generateReferralCode(customerEmail: string): Promise<string> {
  const prefix = customerEmail.split('@')[0].slice(0, 4).toUpperCase();
  const randomSuffix = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 6).toUpperCase();
  return `${prefix}-${randomSuffix}`; // e.g., JANE-4X9B
}

// Capture referral source from URL param ?ref=CODE into a 30-day cookie
export function setReferralCookie(urlParams: URLSearchParams) {
  const refCode = urlParams.get('ref');
  if (refCode) {
    document.cookie = `referral_source=${refCode}; max-age=${30 * 86400}; path=/; samesite=lax`;
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Native Platform Configuration

#### Shopify Admin
1.  **Discount Codes:** Create a "Master" discount code (e.g., 10% off for new customers) that is restricted to "One use per customer" and "New customers only."
2.  **Customer Tagging:** When a referral converts, use **Shopify Flow** to tag the Referrer with `referral_earned`. Trigger an automated email to the Referrer with their reward code once the order status is "Fulfilled."

#### WooCommerce Admin
1.  Use the native **Coupons** system to generate unique codes.
2.  Restrict coupons to specific email addresses or "First-time buyers only" to prevent public sharing on coupon aggregator sites.

### Step 3: Fraud Prevention & Edge Cases

Referral programs are highly susceptible to "Self-Referral" and "Coupon Hijacking."

- **IP & Address Matching:** Block rewards if the Referrer and Referee share the same IP address or Shipping Address.
- **Minimum Order Value (MOV):** Require the Referee to spend at least 2x the reward value (e.g., spend $50 to get $10 off) to prevent "Zero-Dollar" orders.
- **The "Coupon Site" Hijack:** Monitor for referral codes that generate >50 conversions in 24 hours. These have likely been posted to RetailMeNot or Honey. Automate the deactivation of codes exceeding a "Velocity Threshold."
- **Return Window Lag:** Do not issue the Referrer's reward until the Referee's order has passed the 30-day return window.

### Step 4: Measuring the "Viral Loop"

Use SQL to calculate your **Viral Coefficient (K-factor)**:
`K = (Number of invites sent per customer) * (Conversion rate of those invites)`

```sql
-- Calculate Referral Success Rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT referrer_id) as active_advocates,
  COUNT(DISTINCT referee_id) as new_customers,
  CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT referee_id) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(DISTINCT referrer_id) as k_factor
FROM referral_transactions
WHERE status = 'completed'
AND created_at > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';
```
*Note: A K-factor of > 1.0 means exponential organic growth (rare). A healthy ecommerce K-factor is 0.15 - 0.25.*

## Benchmarks & Performance Targets

| Metric | Healthy | Elite |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Referral Participation Rate** | 2% - 5% | > 10% |
| **Referral Conversion Rate** | 8% - 12% | > 20% |
| **Referral Share of Revenue** | 3% - 7% | > 15% |
| **Incremental LTV (Referred)** | +15% vs. Cold | +40% vs. Cold |

## Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

- **Broken Attribution:** If a customer switches from mobile (where they clicked the link) to desktop (where they buy), the cookie is lost. **Mitigation:** Allow Referrers to share a "Plain Text Code" that can be entered at checkout, in addition to the link.
- **Tax Implications:** In some jurisdictions (e.g., US), if a Referrer earns >$600 in "Cash" or "Gift Card" rewards annually, you may be required to issue a 1099 form. Use "Store Credit" to mitigate this.
- **Friction in Sharing:** If the referral link is hidden behind a 3-step login, sharing will drop by 80%. Ensure "One-Click Share to WhatsApp/iMessage" is available on the mobile confirmation page.
