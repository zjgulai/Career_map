# LoopX /loopx-global-risks

Treat this as the LoopX `/loopx-global-risks` slash command.

Visible command arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`.
Run `loopx global-risks` first and summarize structured stale runs, boundary warnings, failing checks, and whether a formally evidenced rollback candidate source is available, without mutating state.
This command is read-only unless the user explicitly asks for a state update.

Keep public/private boundaries intact and do not perform external writes unless the active LoopX state or owner explicitly authorizes them.
