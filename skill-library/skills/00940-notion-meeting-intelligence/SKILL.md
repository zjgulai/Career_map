# Meeting Intelligence

Prep meetings by pulling Notion context, tailoring agendas/pre-reads, and enriching with supplemental research.

## Quick start
1) Confirm meeting goal, attendees, date/time, and decisions needed.
2) Gather context: search with `Notion:search`, then fetch with `Notion:fetch` (prior notes, specs, OKRs, decisions).
3) Pick the right template via `reference/template-selection-guide.md` (status, decision, planning, retro, 1:1, brainstorming).
4) Draft agenda/pre-read in Notion with `Notion:notion-create-pages`, embedding source links and owner/timeboxes.
5) Enrich with supplemental research (industry insights, benchmarks, risks) and update the page with `Notion:notion-update-page` as plans change.

## Tool-call guardrails
- Notion tool availability can vary by workspace. If a Notion MCP call returns `Tool <name> not found`, treat that tool as unavailable for the rest of the current task. Do not retry it with different arguments or call it again later; use `Notion:search` and `Notion:fetch` where sufficient.
- Use one literal search query per `Notion:search` call and include `filters: {}` when no narrower filter is needed.
- Only fetch Notion page, database, or data-source URLs/IDs; external connected-source search results are not valid `Notion:fetch` inputs.
- Create meeting pages with an explicit `parent` and a `pages` array.
- Query databases with `Notion:notion-query-data-sources` under a top-level `data` object, using fetched `collection://...` URLs as table names.
- When editing a page, fetch its current content first and use `Notion:notion-update-page` with supported commands such as `update_content` or `update_properties`; on the current deployed surface, use `properties: {}` for `update_content` and `content_updates: []` for `update_properties`. Do not invent insertion-only commands.

## Workflow
### 0) If Notion tools are unavailable, pause and ask the user to connect the Notion app:
1. Enable the bundled Notion app for this plugin or session.
2. Complete the Notion auth flow if prompted.
3. Start a new session if the tools still do not appear.

After the app is connected, finish your answer and tell the user to retry so they can continue with Step 1.

### 1) Gather inputs
- Ask for objective, desired outcomes/decisions, attendees, duration, date/time, and prior materials.
- Search Notion for relevant docs, past notes, specs, and action items (`Notion:search`), then fetch key pages (`Notion:fetch`).
- Capture blockers/risks and open questions up front.

### 2) Choose format
- Status/update → status template.
- Decision/approval → decision template.
- Planning (sprint/project) → planning template.
- Retro/feedback → retrospective template.
- 1:1 → one-on-one template.
- Ideation → brainstorming template.
- Use `reference/template-selection-guide.md` to confirm.

### 3) Build the agenda/pre-read
- Start from the chosen template in `reference/` and adapt sections (context, goals, agenda, owner/time per item, decisions, risks, prep asks).
- Include links to pulled Notion pages and any required pre-reading.
- Assign owners for each agenda item; call out timeboxes and expected outputs.

### 4) Enrich with research
- Add concise supplemental research where helpful: market/industry facts, benchmarks, risks, best practices.
- Keep claims cited with source links; separate fact from opinion.

### 5) Finalize and share
- Add next steps and owners for follow-ups.
- If tasks arise, create/link tasks in the relevant Notion database.
- Update the page via `Notion:notion-update-page` when details change; keep a brief changelog if multiple edits.

- `reference/` — template picker and meeting templates (e.g., `template-selection-guide.md`, `status-update-template.md`, `decision-meeting-template.md`, `sprint-planning-template.md`, `one-on-one-template.md`, `retrospective-template.md`, `brainstorming-template.md`).
- `examples/` — end-to-end meeting preps (e.g., `executive-review.md`, `project-decision.md`, `sprint-planning.md`, `customer-meeting.md`).
