# Canva Resize for Social Media

Automatically resize a single Canva design into multiple social media formats.

## Overview

This skill enables rapid multi-platform content distribution by taking a single Canva design and creating optimized versions for:
- Facebook post
- Facebook story
- Instagram post
- Instagram story
- LinkedIn post

All resized versions are provided with Canva edit links so users can further edit or download them directly from Canva.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Source Design

Determine which Canva design the user wants to resize. This can be provided in three ways:

1. **Direct design ID**: User provides a design ID (starts with "D")
   - Example: "resize design DABcd1234ef for all social media"
   - Use the design ID directly with `get-design` tool to retrieve design information

2. **Direct design URL**: User provides a Canva design link
   - Example: "resize https://www.canva.com/design/DABcd1234ef/... for all social media"
   - Extract the design ID from the URL (the part after `/design/` and before the next `/` or query parameter)
   - Use the extracted design ID with `get-design` tool

3. **Search by design name**: Use `search-designs` tool with the design name as the query
   - Example: "resize my Demo Brand Template: Brix&Hart Flyer design for all social media"
   - Use the exact name/phrase the user provides as the search query
   - If multiple matches are found, present options and ask the user to select one

4. **Current context**: If the user just created or edited a design in the conversation, use that design ID

**Implementation note**: When searching by name, pass the design name directly to `search-designs` as the query parameter. The tool will find the best match based on the design title.

### Step 2: Retrieve Source Design Information

Use the `get-design` tool with the design ID to:
- Confirm the design exists and is accessible
- Get the design title (for naming resized versions)
- Verify design type compatibility

### Step 3: Ask Which Platforms and Formats

Present the available formats and ask which ones the user wants:

```
Which platforms and formats would you like to resize for?

- Facebook post (1200×630)
- Facebook story (1080×1920)
- Instagram post (1080×1080)
- Instagram story (1080×1920)
- LinkedIn post (1200×627)
```

If the user says "all" or "all social media", use all five. Otherwise, only resize for the ones they select.

### Step 4: Resize to Selected Formats

Execute the resize operations **in parallel** by calling the `resize-design` tool once for each selected format. Use these exact specifications:

**Available formats and dimensions:**

1. **Facebook Post**: 1200 × 630 pixels (custom)
   ```
   design_type: { type: "custom", width: 1200, height: 630 }
   ```

2. **Facebook Story**: 1080 × 1920 pixels (custom)
   ```
   design_type: { type: "custom", width: 1080, height: 1920 }
   ```

3. **Instagram Post**: 1080 × 1080 pixels (custom)
   ```
   design_type: { type: "custom", width: 1080, height: 1080 }
   ```

4. **Instagram Story**: 1080 × 1920 pixels (custom)
   ```
   design_type: { type: "custom", width: 1080, height: 1920 }
   ```

5. **LinkedIn Post**: 1200 × 627 pixels (custom)
   ```
   design_type: { type: "custom", width: 1200, height: 627 }
   ```

**Note**: Facebook Story and Instagram Story have identical dimensions. Create both versions but inform the user they're the same size.

**Error handling**: If a resize operation fails, continue with remaining formats and report which formats succeeded and which failed at the end.

### Step 5: Present Results with Edit Links

**Present comprehensive results to the user:**

Provide the user with a summary including:

1. **Summary**: Confirm which formats were created successfully
2. **Design edit links**: Canva editor URLs for each resized design so users can make further edits or download directly from Canva
3. **Note about duplicates**: Mention that Facebook Story and Instagram Story have identical dimensions

**Presentation format example:**
```
✅ Successfully resized your design for all social media platforms!

Edit Links:

**Facebook Post** (1200×630)
- [Edit in Canva](edit_url)

**Facebook Story** (1080×1920)
- [Edit in Canva](edit_url)

**Instagram Post** (1080×1080)
- [Edit in Canva](edit_url)

**Instagram Story** (1080×1920)
- [Edit in Canva](edit_url)

**LinkedIn Post** (1200×627)
- [Edit in Canva](edit_url)

Note: Facebook Story and Instagram Story use the same dimensions (1080×1920).
```

**Implementation details**:
- Design edit links come from the `resize-design` tool response (use the `urls.edit_url` field from each resized design)
- Present links as clickable URLs, not just plain text
- Organize by platform for easy scanning

## Key Implementation Notes

- **Compatibility**: Check if `resize-design` is available in the current MCP tools. If not, inform the user that this skill requires the Canva MCP resize tool in the current host
- **Parallel execution**: Resize operations should be performed in parallel for efficiency
- **Consistent naming**: Use the source design title with platform suffix for resized designs
- **Error resilience**: If any operation fails, complete the remaining operations and clearly report what succeeded/failed
- **User confirmation**: Do not require user approval between steps - execute the full workflow automatically unless errors occur
- **Format accuracy**: Always use the exact pixel dimensions specified above for each platform
