name: consultation
description: Consult for ordinary material architecture, interface, data-model, or explicit advisor, generic-advisor, authorization, challenge, second-opinion, or architecture-review choices; or, when targeted evidence still leaves unresolved cross-module or system design, compatibility or concurrency boundaries, competing diagnoses, security, privacy, or trust boundaries, recovery, irreversible-state migration, or data-loss decisions; and the completion consultation that complex multi-phase or multi-file work takes before it is declared complete. Skip factual/status/summarization work, fully determined mechanical edits, formatting/renaming/docs synchronization, settled-plan execution, final review owned elsewhere, explicit no-delegation/root-only requests, and every borderline case.

# Advisor consultation

Use one fresh, read-only, zero-tool advisor only when the task has a concrete material
decision. The root owns architecture, implementation routing, verification, and acceptance.
Before consultation, the root performs any repository or web research and supplies
enough relevant evidence and source references in the five-section decision packet for
the advisor to recommend a path.

The root may assign bounded evidence gathering to separate research workers before assembling the decision packet; the consulted advisor still uses zero tools and never delegates.

If that evidence cannot settle the question, a valid
advisor result may instead identify a concrete research-first next step, missing
evidence, research questions, or bounded brainstorming areas. The advisor does not
inspect files, call tools, fetch the web, or conduct independent research.

## Declare the route

Read-only discovery may ground the decision. For a consult candidate, inspect the
parent identity before the first implementation write and before its decision record:

```sh
sh <absolute-installed-plugin-root>/scripts/inspect-parent-runtime.sh
```

The preflight uses only `CODEX_THREAD_ID` and the caller-supplied/default sessions
root. It accepts an unambiguous persisted parent with a recognized sandbox policy;
the parent itself need not be read-only because the consultation runs in a distinct
explicitly read-only Codex process. A missing, ambiguous, malformed, or conflicting
parent runtime is unavailable. Do not use `CODEX_SESSION_ID` as a fallback. Emit
exactly one record:

```text
ADVISOR DECISION
route: consult | skip | unavailable
reason: <one task-specific sentence>
question: <bounded decision question, or none>
```

Consult when at least one positive trigger in the description applies. Skip when all
applicable work is routine, the user forbids delegation, or eligibility is borderline.
General quality is not a decision question.

Complex work takes one completion consultation before it is declared complete. This
applies when the task already took `route: consult`, or when it spans multiple phases,
files, or sessions. Emit a second `ADVISOR DECISION` and consult before reporting the
work done. The bounded question is whether the finished work meets its stated contract
and what evidence would falsify that. It is not a final diff review or release
verification, which stay outside this plugin and with their existing owner: the root
still owns verification and acceptance, and the advisor still uses zero tools and sees
only the packet. Routine, single-step, and already-skipped work takes no completion
consultation.

An identified parent uses `route: consult`, including a normal `workspace-write`
root. An unavailable parent uses `route: unavailable`, emits no `ADVISOR CALL`,
starts no consultation process, and does not block the root's own work. The ordinary
`route: skip` path is unchanged.
A non-Codex surface has no supported local transport, so it takes `route: unavailable` and emits no `ADVISOR CALL` or `ADVISOR RESULT`.

## Explicit configuration is separate

The bundled installed `advisor.toml` is live configuration for normal `--tier`
consultations. It contains exactly `[standard]` and `[specialist]`, each with `model`
and `effort`; edit it in place and the next consultation uses the pair. No catalog,
discovery, canary, saved state, or file copy is a prerequisite. Any syntactically valid
future selector is permitted subject to account/runtime support; `gpt-6-astra` for
Specialist opts into higher usage. Plugin updates or reinstalling can replace edits.
The helper's `show` and `doctor` report the actual pairs, installed path, and SHA-256
source revision. Catalogs, presets, and canaries are isolated advanced tools; `set`
and `reset` reject as legacy-only, and `restore` states that it cannot affect tiers.

`models test MODEL --effort EFFORT --authorize-usage --parent-thread THREAD_ID`
uses model capacity. Never infer that authorization from catalog metadata, a saved
selection, or a configuration request. CLI `0.153.2` app-server currently lacks the
isolation flags required for safe discovery, so `models refresh` safely returns
unavailable without changing state; it is not a live model canary.

## Consult exactly

1. Resolve the absolute installed plugin root from this loaded `SKILL.md` path: it is
   two directories above the directory containing this file. Verify that
   `run-advisor.sh`, `inspect-parent-runtime.sh`, and `inspect-agent-runtime.sh` are
   regular, nonsymlinked files beneath that installed root. Use those absolute paths
   for every consultation command. Never elevate a repository-relative or
   workspace-resolved `plugins/advisor` script.
2. Classify the decision risk. Standard consultation uses
   `--tier standard`. Its live file model and effort default to Terra / `high` with no
   setup, discovery, or canary. This permits the real consultation attempt, not a
   compatibility claim; post-run runtime inspection remains required. This is the
   default for ordinary bounded material architecture, interface, data-model, and
   explicit generic advisor requests.
   Specialist consultation uses `--tier specialist`. Its live file model and effort
   default to Sol / `high` with the same zero-setup launch permission, only when
   targeted evidence still leaves unresolved a cross-module or system design,
   compatibility or concurrency boundary, competing diagnosis, an unresolved security or trust boundary, recovery, an irreversible migration or data-loss decision, or a credible unresolved High-severity disagreement. Security adjacency or project importance alone, or an ordinary architecture question alone, does not qualify. A borderline choice uses Standard. The parent model and sandbox are irrelevant to selection.
3. Resolve the selected tier through the installed helper. Before invoking the
   consultation transport, emit this visible main-chat receipt using the actual resolved model and effort metadata:

```text
ADVISOR CALL
tier: Standard | Specialist
model: <resolved model selector>
effort: <resolved effort>
reason: <one task-specific sentence>
question: <bounded decision question>
status: running
```

4. Send only this bounded, non-sensitive packet to the fixed transport on stdin:

```text
DECISION
<one question the root must resolve>

CONTEXT
<goal, relevant root-gathered evidence with source references, and current constraints>

OPTIONS
<known viable choices, including the tentative choice when one exists>

BOUNDARIES
<owned files, excluded scope, compatibility, security, and authority limits>

REQUEST
Challenge the tentative choice. Recommend one path when the packet supports a
decision; otherwise identify a concrete research-first next step, specific missing evidence,
research questions, or bounded brainstorming areas. Identify the strongest
counterargument, name evidence that would change the recommendation, and give
specific acceptance checks. Use zero tools: do not inspect files, call tools, fetch
the web, or conduct independent research. Do not perform or delegate the follow-up.
```

Require the model to emit exactly one object conforming to the installed
`advisor-response.schema.json`, with no prose or code fences. This JSON Schema is
the sole supported wrapper model-output format. Direct/native role invocation is unsupported and is not schema-validated. The required fields are:

```text
recommendation, why, strongest_objection, change_my_mind, risks,
follow_up_areas: required nonblank strings
acceptance_checks: required nonempty array of nonblank strings
```

5. Run exactly one selected consultation. Invoke the fixed installed-plugin wrapper
   with the shell tool's `sandbox_permissions: require_escalated` boundary and a
   narrow justification for launching one read-only Advisor child. Do not first try
   the wrapper inside the parent sandbox: nested Codex app-server initialization is
   blocked there. The elevation applies only to the fixed launcher; the consultation
   process itself is forced to `--sandbox read-only` and must pass runtime inspection.
   Do not call `codex exec` directly and do not pass a model or effort override;
   `run-advisor.sh` resolves the selected tier once, uses its exact live-file model and
   effort, forces `--sandbox read-only`, starts a fresh
   `codex exec` thread using existing Codex authentication, and never reads or copies
   authentication files:

```sh
/bin/sh <absolute-installed-plugin-root>/scripts/run-advisor.sh --tier standard <<'ADVISOR_PACKET'
DECISION
<the complete five-section packet continues here>
ADVISOR_PACKET
# or use: --tier specialist
```

When the shell tool is called through the Codex tool runtime, a deferred result
must be drained before it is classified. Use this caller-side pattern for every
tier and role (the wrapper's model does not change the handoff contract):

```javascript
let process = await tools.exec_command({cmd: transportCommand});
let combinedOutput = process.output ?? "";
while (process.session_id) {
  process = await tools.write_stdin({
    session_id: process.session_id,
    chars: "",
    yield_time_ms: 5000,
    max_output_tokens: 20000,
  });
  combinedOutput += process.output ?? "";
}
if (process.session_id || process.exit_code == null) {
  throw new Error("Advisor transport did not reach a terminal result");
}
if (process.exit_code !== 0) {
  throw new Error("Advisor transport failed");
}
const candidates = combinedOutput.split(/\r?\n/).flatMap((line) => {
  try { return [JSON.parse(line)]; } catch { return []; }
}).filter((value) => value && value.schema_version === 3);
if (candidates.length !== 1) {
  throw new Error("Advisor transport did not return exactly one schema-v3 envelope");
}
const verifiedEnvelope = candidates[0];
text(JSON.stringify(verifiedEnvelope));
```

A nonempty `session_id` from `exec_command` is nonterminal: keep polling the
same session with `write_stdin` and preserve every returned output chunk in
`combinedOutput`. The initial yielded result is nonterminal progress, never an
Advisor envelope. Likewise, an outer `functions.wait` result or heartbeat is nonterminal progress.
Do not parse it, emit a receipt, or classify the consultation until the owning
`functions.exec` call has drained the exact process and validated its terminal
output. Parse `combinedOutput` only after the process has no `session_id` and a
terminal `exit_code`. Because the shell tool may merge stderr progress into
`output`, extract exactly one parseable `schema_version: 3` JSON object from the
complete accumulator and reject zero or multiple candidates. Only then use
`text(JSON.stringify(verifiedEnvelope))` to deliver that verified envelope from
the enclosing `functions.exec`; nested shell-tool output is not itself a result.

   Use this single-quoted heredoc form, after proving the delimiter is absent from the
   packet. Never use `< packet.txt`, an unquoted heredoc, `eval`, or shell-interpolated
   packet text at this elevated boundary. The packet exists only on the wrapper's
   stdin; do not stage it in a workspace-writable file.

   The wrapper writes progress only to stderr and emits one verified JSON object on
   stdout. It runtime-inspects every launched child before classifying that child's
   response. Wrapper-owned semantic validation rejects malformed JSON, duplicate,
   missing, extra, wrong-type, noncontiguous-array, or blank schema fields, then
   deterministically renders the accepted object as this exact canonical eight-line
   receipt:

```text
ADVISOR RESPONSE
RECOMMENDATION: <recommendation>
WHY: <why>
STRONGEST OBJECTION: <strongest_objection>
CHANGE MY MIND: <change_my_mind>
ACCEPTANCE CHECKS: <acceptance checks joined by ; >
RISKS: <risks>
FOLLOW-UP AREAS: <follow_up_areas>
```

   Mandatory post-response inspection proves the exact frozen model and effort,
   read-only isolation, distinct-thread identity, `codex_exec` provenance,
   and zero tool calls before validation can succeed. When the first child proves the exact frozen model and effort,
   read-only runtime, distinct thread, allowlisted `codex_exec` or `Codex Desktop`
   provenance, and zero tool calls but
   returns a runtime-valid response-validation failure, the wrapper emits only its
   redacted failure `class` and `field` on stderr and performs exactly one fresh
   corrective retry using the same frozen model and effort. The retry prompt names only that
   diagnostic, never rejected content. A consultation launches at most two children.
   Packet, launcher, event, identity,
   same-session, runtime, wrong-model, wrong-effort, non-read-only, normalization, provenance, or tool-use failure
   is terminal and never retries. A second response-validation failure fails closed.
   Rejected content is never emitted, accepted, merged, or copied into the retry
   prompt. Every attempt artifact remains only in one private mode-0700 consultation directory beneath the private transport root; an unconditional exit trap removes
   that directory after every wrapper exit.
6. Receive the required advisor response from the verified JSON without supplying
   more context or asking it to research. A valid processed response contains either
   a recommendation grounded in the packet or a concrete research-first follow-up
   under `FOLLOW-UP AREAS`.
7. Treat a response that passed mandatory runtime inspection as evidence and verify
   its cited source references. For a research-first response, treat the concise
   research-first plan as the recommendation and its concrete inquiries as
   `FOLLOW-UP AREAS`. Then record `accept`, `modify`, or `reject` with one reason:
   `accept` means the root accepts the returned technical recommendation or
   research-first plan, never a technical choice that the advisor did not make.
   After runtime evidence and advice processing, always emit this visible
   main-chat receipt:

```text
ADVISOR RESULT
status: completed | unavailable
tier: Standard | Specialist
model: <verified resolved model selector>
effort: <verified resolved effort>
isolation: read-only
recommendation: <concise recommendation, or unavailable>
decision: accept | modify | reject | blocked
reason: <one sentence>
```

8. After a valid, runtime-inspected completed result, the root may route only the
   identified research or brainstorming follow-up to an appropriate Luna or Terra
   subagent outside this consultation, synthesize that work, and optionally start a
   fresh consultation with a new `ADVISOR CALL` and `ADVISOR RESULT` receipt. Those
   subagents do not rescue or alter the original consultation result. An unavailable result cannot be rescued by follow-up work.
9. The advisor may not spawn, route, research, implement, or review final work. Do
   not independently spawn a replacement or second advisor, implementer, or final
   reviewer as part of this consultation. The wrapper-owned response retry above is
   the only permitted second child.

`completed` requires a processed advisor response with either a recommendation or a
concrete `FOLLOW-UP AREAS` entry, plus mandatory post-response runtime inspection.
Any unavailable runtime evidence, non-read-only runtime policy, tool-use evidence, or
required advice produces `status: unavailable`,
`recommendation: unavailable`, and `decision: blocked` and remains fail-closed.
These receipts summarize verified evidence; they are not runtime proof.
The distinct Codex consultation thread remains the inspectable detailed record.

If exact completed transport evidence is unavailable, report `advisor unavailable`
and block the consult route. Never continue independently, substitute another model
or effort, or add an implementer or final reviewer after choosing `consult`.

For `skip` or `unavailable`, emit only the existing `ADVISOR DECISION`; do not emit
`ADVISOR CALL` or `ADVISOR RESULT`, and do not start the transport. An unavailable parent does not
block root-owned work.

See [operations](references/operations.md) for installation, runtime evidence, and
evaluation details.

Legacy cached integrations may use `--role advisor-terra` or `--role advisor-sol`.
Those compatibility routes remain fixed to Terra/high and Sol/high and do not follow
`advisor.toml`. They cannot be combined with a tier or preset. New calls use the tier
interface above; raw model and effort flags are never accepted by the wrapper.
The explicit `--role advisor-astra` route is a separate fixed opt-in to gpt-6-astra/high.
It is never selected by Standard/Specialist defaults, trigger selection, fallback, or
audit tier counts, and cannot be combined with a tier or preset.
