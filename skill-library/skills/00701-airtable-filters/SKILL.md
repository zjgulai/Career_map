# Airtable MCP Filters

MCP tools that list or display records from tables or interface pages accept an optional `filters` parameter, using the same schema.

When querying records from an interface page, these filters are combined with the page's built-in filters using AND.

## Schema shape

When no top-level `operator` is specified, conditions are combined with AND. The first element in a condition's `operands` array is always a **field ID** — look up the table's schema to find field IDs before filtering.

## Field type categories

-   **Text-like**: singleLineText, multilineText, email, url, phoneNumber, richText, barcode
-   **Numeric**: number, percent, currency, rating, duration, autoNumber, count
-   **Date**: date, dateTime, createdTime, lastModifiedTime
-   **Single select**: singleSelect
-   **Multiple selects**: multipleSelects
-   **Single collaborator**: singleCollaborator
-   **Multiple collaborators**: multipleCollaborators
-   **Linked records**: multipleRecordLinks
-   **Attachment**: multipleAttachments
-   **Checkbox**: checkbox

Computed fields (formula, rollup, lookup) support whichever operators match their result type.

| `doesNotContain`        | array of IDs                       | multiple selects, multiple collaborators                                                                                           |
| `isEmpty`, `isNotEmpty` | _(none)_                           | text-like, numeric, date, single select, multiple selects, single collaborator, multiple collaborators, linked records, attachment |

| `isAnyOf`               | array of IDs                       | single select, single collaborator                                                                                                 |
| `isNoneOf`              | array of IDs                       | single select, single collaborator, linked records                                                                                 |
| `isWithin`              | date range object                  | date                                                                                                                               |
| `filename`, `fileType`  | string or `"image"`/`"text"`       | attachment                                                                                                                         |

When matching a field against multiple values, prefer dedicated operators (`isAnyOf`, `isNoneOf`, `hasAnyOf`, `hasAllOf`) over combining multiple `=` conditions with `or`/`and`, when those operators are available for the field type.

## Field-type rules

### Select fields

For select fields, operand values must be **choice IDs** (e.g., `"selABCDEFGHIJKLM"`), not display names. Look up the table's schema to find choice IDs before filtering.

### Collaborator fields

When filtering by a collaborator group ID, use `operatorOptions` to match individual members of the group instead of the literal group ID. See the tool's `operatorOptions` parameter for details.

Example operand: `{"operator": "hasAnyOf", "operands": ["fldCRi9oz2vRLcIWr", "ugpDUVUnftA7H9bG8"], "operatorOptions": {"matchGroupsByMembership": true}}`

### Attachment fields

Use `fileType` to filter attachments by type (e.g., `"image"`, `"text"`) rather than `isNotEmpty` when the user specifies a file type.

### Date fields

Date comparisons (`=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) use a date value object instead of a raw date string, and `isWithin` uses a date range object. The tool schema defines the available modes for each. Always include `timeZone`.

## Composing conditions

A filter's top-level operands array can contain two or more conditions, which are combined with the top-level operator (AND by default). For simple multi-condition filters, this flat structure is sufficient.

When the logic requires mixing AND and OR, nest a filter object as one of the operands. Each nested filter has its own operator and operands.

**OR inside AND** — useful when one condition is fixed and another allows multiple alternatives:

> "Scripted videos that are either in Writing or Pre-Production"
> → Bucket = Scripted AND (Status = Writing OR Status = Pre-Production)

**AND inside OR** — useful when you want records matching either a simple condition or a combination:

> "Approved videos, or videos assigned to Bailey that are in Cut 2"
> → Status = Approved OR (Editor = Bailey AND Status = Cut 2 Ready)

When combining many conditions on different fields, prefer a flat AND rather than unnecessary nesting. Only nest when the logic genuinely requires mixed AND/OR at different levels.

Prefer composing all conditions into a single `filters` object rather than splitting them across multiple calls. A single call with a composed filter is more efficient and returns the correct result set directly.

## Examples

Filter where a text field equals "orange" OR a number field is greater than 5:

```json
{
    "operator": "or",
    "operands": [
        {"operator": "=", "operands": ["fld8WsrpLHHevsnW8", "orange"]},
        {"operator": ">", "operands": ["fldulcCPDVz87Bmnw", 5]}
    ]
}
```

Filter for records where a date field is within the past week:

```json
{
    "operands": [
        {
            "operator": "isWithin",
            "operands": ["fldABC12345678x", {"mode": "pastWeek", "timeZone": "America/New_York"}]
        }
    ]
}
```
