# Knowledge Capture

Convert conversations and notes into structured, linkable Notion pages for easy reuse.

## Quick start
1) Clarify what to capture (decision, how-to, FAQ, learning, documentation) and target audience.
2) Identify the right database/template in `reference/` (team wiki, how-to, FAQ, decision log, learning, documentation).
3) Pull any prior context from Notion with `Notion:search` → `Notion:fetch` (existing pages to update/link).
4) Draft the page with `Notion:notion-create-pages` using the database’s schema; include summary, context, source links, and tags/owners.
5) Link from hub pages and related records; update status/owners with `Notion:notion-update-page` as the source evolves.

## Tool-call guardrails
- Notion tool availability can vary by workspace. If a Notion MCP call returns `Tool <name> not found`, treat that tool as unavailable for the rest of the current task. Do not retry it with different arguments or call it again later; use `Notion:search` and `Notion:fetch` where sufficient.
- Use one literal search query per `Notion:search` call and include `filters: {}` when no narrower filter is needed. If several query variants are useful, issue separate searches instead of writing `or` or `+` inside one query string.
- Only pass Notion page, database, or data-source URLs/IDs to `Notion:fetch`. Search can also surface external connected-source URLs; use those as context or citations, but do not feed them into `fetch`.
- Create pages with an explicit `parent` and a `pages` array. For database-backed pages, fetch the database first and use the returned `collection://...` data source ID.
- To edit existing page content, fetch the current page first, then use `Notion:notion-update-page` with `command: "update_content"`, `properties: {}`, and exact `old_str` / full replacement `new_str` pairs. For property-only edits, use `command: "update_properties"` with `content_updates: []`. The current deployed schema expects both top-level fields even when one is unused. Do not invent insertion-only commands.

## Workflow
### 0) If Notion tools are unavailable, pause and ask the user to connect the Notion app:
1. Enable the bundled Notion app for this plugin or session.
2. Complete the Notion auth flow if prompted.
3. Start a new session if the tools still do not appear.

After the app is connected, finish your answer and tell the user to retry so they can continue with Step 1.

### 1) Define the capture
- Ask purpose, audience, freshness, and whether this is new or an update.
- Determine content type: decision, how-to, FAQ, concept/wiki entry, learning/note, documentation page.

### 2) Locate destination
- Pick the correct database using `reference/*-database.md` guides; confirm required properties (title, tags, owner, status, date, relations).
- If multiple candidate databases, ask the user which to use; otherwise, create in the primary wiki/documentation DB.

### 3) Extract and structure
- Extract facts, decisions, actions, and rationale from the conversation.
- For decisions, record alternatives, rationale, and outcomes.
- For how-tos/docs, capture steps, pre-reqs, links to assets/code, and edge cases.
- For FAQs, phrase as Q&A with concise answers and links to deeper docs.

### 4) Create/update in Notion
- Use `Notion:notion-create-pages` with the correct `data_source_id`; set properties (title, tags, owner, status, dates, relations).
- Use templates in `reference/` to structure content (section headers, checklists).
- If updating an existing page, fetch then edit via `Notion:notion-update-page`.

### 5) Link and surface
- Add relations/backlinks to hub pages, related specs/docs, and teams.
- Add a short summary/changelog for future readers.
- If follow-up tasks exist, create tasks in the relevant database and link them.

## References and examples
- `reference/` — database schemas and templates (e.g., `team-wiki-database.md`, `how-to-guide-database.md`, `faq-database.md`, `decision-log-database.md`, `documentation-database.md`, `learning-database.md`, `database-best-practices.md`).
- `examples/` — capture patterns in practice (e.g., `decision-capture.md`, `how-to-guide.md`, `conversation-to-faq.md`).
