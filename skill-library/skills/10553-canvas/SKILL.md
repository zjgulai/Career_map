# Canvas

Canvas is the Blueprint placement surface. It owns Canvas metadata and Widget placement state:

- `mountId`
- `widgetId`
- layout
- z-order
- placement-local view state

Widget definition, data, input, Binding, and Automation execution remain owned by their respective assets.

When Binding delivery includes output `FileResourceRef` values, the host projects them as placement attachments. Host-owned actions support preview, download, reveal, and copying the safe ref; Widget iframe code must not expose local paths, fabricate download URLs, or call native file actions directly.

## Standard Flow

Use generated ids from tool responses:

```text
Canvas.list or Canvas.create
-> Widget.create or Widget.list/Widget.read
-> write and validate Widget index.html when creating or adapting
-> Canvas.placeWidget({ canvasId, widgetId, layout })
-> Canvas.read({ canvasId })
```

For Canvas-only display, place the Widget directly. Use `Widget.show` only when the user also wants conversation or dock display.

### Bring a conversation Widget onto Canvas

Before placing a Widget designed for conversation display, read `widgetdesign/SKILL.md` and
`widgetdesign/references/layout-and-sizing.md`, even if the inline version already renders well.
Read the existing `index.html`, choose a placement size that suits its content, and adjust the
layout only where needed for that viewport and the host's drag region and hover controls. Keep
working content and interactions. The same HTML still serves the conversation, so preserve its
content-driven root height. Validate any HTML changes, then check the Widget in the chosen Canvas
placement; adapting or testing every other size is unnecessary unless requested.

## Conversation Preview

Use `daimon-canvas` to give the user a clickable conversation entry point that opens a Canvas in the client side panel. Emit it after creating a Canvas, placing Widgets on a Canvas, or whenever directing the user to a specific Canvas:

```daimon-canvas
canvasId: canvas_generated
title: Canvas title
```

Rules:

1. `canvasId` is required. Use a real id returned by `Canvas.create`, `Canvas.list`, or `Canvas.read`; never invent or guess one.
2. `title` is optional but recommended. Use the Canvas title so the entry is recognizable.
3. The preview only opens an existing Canvas. It neither creates a Canvas nor displays Canvas content inline.

## Place And Update

Default grid placement:

```json
{
  "action": "placeWidget",
  "canvasId": "canvas_generated",
  "widgetId": "widget_generated",
  "layout": { "mode": "grid", "x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 5, "h": 8 }
}
```

Update layout and placement-local state:

```json
{
  "action": "updatePlacement",
  "canvasId": "canvas_generated",
  "mountId": "mount_generated",
  "layout": { "mode": "grid", "x": 5, "y": 0, "w": 5, "h": 8 },
  "viewState": { "main": { "tab": "overview" } }
}
```

`layout` is exactly `{ mode, x, y, w, h }`, where mode is `"grid"` or `"free"`. Pass `zOrder` as a top-level field. Omit it when normal front-most ordering is sufficient.

## Current Size Model

Grid defaults:

- 12 columns
- column width `80px`
- row height `32px`
- gap `12px`
- horizontal step `92px`
- vertical step `44px`

Free-layout placement design policy:

- minimum `240x160`
- default `420x320`
- maximum `960x1440`

Grid placement spans:

- minimum `2x2`
- default `5x8`
- maximum `12x33`

Grid spans include gaps. Width is:

```text
w * 80 + (w - 1) * 12
```

Useful rendered widths:

- 2 columns: `172px`
- 3 columns: `264px`
- 5 columns: `448px`
- 12 columns: `1092px`

Choose a placement size that suits the Widget's content and intended layout; `5x8` is a starting
point when no size is specified. If the Widget was designed for a particular span, place it at
that span. Supporting one chosen size is sufficient unless the user requests multiple sizes.
Judge proportions in rendered pixels: columns and rows have different sizes, so `5x8` renders
as a wide `448x340px` placement. Content-specific layout suggestions live in
`widgetdesign/references/layout-and-sizing.md`.

## Shared And Local State

- `widgetId` identifies shared Widget definition, latest data, status, input state, and active Binding.
- `mountId` identifies one Canvas placement.
- Multiple placements of the same Widget share Widget data and Automation delivery.
- `viewState.main` belongs to one placement and stores presentation state such as a selected tab or local filter.
- `viewState.__daimonCanvasLayouts` is maintained by the renderer for grid/free layout continuity.

Inside a Canvas Widget, read `widget/references/runtime-api.md` before using `window.DaimonCanvas`, then persist placement-local state with `setViewState(...)`.

## Tool Actions

- `list`: resolve Canvas metadata (`canvasId`, `title`, short `purpose`, `widgetCount`) with `limit` and `offset`, then follow `page.nextOffset` until it disappears.
- `create`: create a Canvas and return the generated `canvasId`.
- `read`: read `canvasId`, `title`, `purpose`, and `placements` as an array of `{ mountId, widgetId, layout, zOrder }`; placement-local view state stays out of the default output.
- `update`: change Canvas title or purpose; returns `canvasId`.
- `placeWidget`: place an existing Widget and return the generated `mountId`.
- `updatePlacement`: update layout, z-order, or view state; returns `mountId`.
- `removePlacement`: remove one placement; returns `mountId`.
- `delete`: remove one Canvas and all of its placements; returns `canvasId`.

## Verification

After placement or layout changes, call `Canvas.read` and confirm:

- the `placements` array contains the expected `mountId`
- it references the expected `widgetId`
- layout and z-order match the requested result
- placement-local view state is written through `updatePlacement` and maintained by the host; inspect it with `verbose: true` when debugging

Canvas placement proves layout only. Verify Widget rendering, Binding delivery, and Automation runs through their owning tools.

## Remove And Delete

- `Canvas.removePlacement` removes one placement, its layout, z-order, and placement-local view state.
- `Canvas.delete` removes Canvas metadata and all placements on that Canvas.
- Widgets, Bindings, Automations, run history, and shared Widget data remain available after these Canvas operations.
