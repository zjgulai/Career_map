# Build Ecommerce Financial Reporting Dashboard

## Overview

A financial reporting dashboard consolidates your three core financial statements—P&L (Income Statement), Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow—into a unified view. For ecommerce, the primary value lies in the "Waterfall" structure, which tracks the journey from Gross Sales to Net Profit, accounting for the unique costs of digital commerce like returns, performance marketing, and fulfillment.

A critical distinction must be made between **Platform Data** (what you see in Shopify or WooCommerce) and **GAAP Financials** (what is in your accounting system). A robust dashboard reconciles these two to ensure management and investors are looking at verified, accrual-basis numbers.

## When to Use This Skill

- When preparing monthly financial reviews for leadership or a Board of Directors.
- When you need to identify which sales channels (e.g., DTC vs. Amazon) are actually profitable after all allocated costs.
- When reconciling merchant payouts (Stripe, PayPal) against orders to ensure no revenue is "leaking."
- When moving from manual spreadsheet tracking to an automated, drill-down capable reporting system.

## 1. The Ecommerce P&L Waterfall Structure

Your dashboard should follow this specific hierarchy to surface the health of the business:

```text
INCOME STATEMENT WATERFALL
─────────────────────────────────────────
Gross Revenue (Units Sold × List Price)
  (-) Returns & Refunds
  (-) Discounts & Coupons
= Net Revenue (The "Top Line")

  (-) Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
      [Product Cost + Inbound Freight + Duties]
= Gross Profit
  (Gross Margin % = Gross Profit / Net Revenue)

Operating Expenses (OpEx)
  (-) Fulfillment & Shipping (3PL fees + Postage)
  (-) Marketing (Ad Spend + Creative + Agency)
  (-) Technology (Platform fees + App subscriptions)
  (-) Customer Service Payroll
  (-) G&A (Salaries, Rent, Legal)
= EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization)
```

## 2. Platform-Native Reporting Layers

While the dashboard may live in a visual tool (like a spreadsheet or BI platform), the data must originate from your accounting system (e.g., QuickBooks or Xero) to be considered a "Financial" report.

### Implementing in Your Accounting System:
1.  **Chart of Accounts**: Create specific sub-accounts for "Discounts," "Shipping Income," and "Fulfillment Expense" to avoid lumping them into generic categories.
2.  **Tracking/Classes**: Use "Tracking Categories" (Xero) or "Classes" (QuickBooks) to tag every transaction by Sales Channel (e.g., Shopify, Amazon, Wholesale). This allows the dashboard to generate a **P&L by Channel** with one click.
3.  **Inventory Valuation**: Ensure your accounting system uses either FIFO (First-In, First-Out) or Weighted Average Cost to reflect accurate COGS, rather than just treating inventory purchases as immediate expenses.

## 3. Drill-Down Dimensions

A high-performance dashboard allows users to "unbundle" consolidated totals:

- **By Product Category**: Identify if your "Accessories" category has a 70% margin while "Electronics" is at 30%.
- **By Customer Type**: Compare the profitability of "New" vs. "Returning" customers (factoring in the higher CAC for new acquisitions).
- **By Geography**: Surface unexpected shipping surcharges or tax liabilities in specific regions that are eroding local margins.

## 4. Deepening: Financial Nuance and Anomalies

### Revenue Recognition Discrepancies
Platform data often reports revenue when an order is *placed*. Financial reporting should recognize revenue when the order is *shipped* (or delivered).
- **The Gap**: At the end of a month, "unfulfilled orders" in your store should appear as "Deferred Revenue" (a liability) on your Balance Sheet, not as "Revenue" on your P&L.
- **The Reconciliation**: Your dashboard should include a "Platform vs. Ledger" reconciliation bridge to explain why Shopify's $100k month is recorded as $92k in your accounting system.

### Returns Reserve Methodology
Returns often happen 15–30 days after the sale.
- **Nuance**: To avoid overstating profit in high-volume months (like November), establish a "Returns Reserve." Estimate the expected return rate (e.g., 5%) and deduct it from your monthly Gross Revenue as a provision, rather than waiting for the physical return to hit the books next month.

### Anomaly Detection
Build "Red Flag" alerts into your dashboard for these scenarios:
- **Margin Compression**: If Gross Margin drops >3% month-over-month, trigger a drill-down into "Inbound Freight" or "Discount Stacking."
- **Ad Spend Pacing**: If "Marketing as % of Net Revenue" (MER) exceeds 25% for three consecutive days, alert the growth team.
- **Shipping Leakage**: Compare "Shipping Income" (what customers paid) against "Shipping Expense" (what you paid carriers). A widening gap signals the need for a shipping rate adjustment.

## 5. The Executive Reporting Package

For board or investor reporting, provide a "Standardized View" including:

1.  **Summary Scorecard**: Net Revenue, Gross Margin %, EBITDA %, and Month-End Cash Balance.
2.  **Variance to Budget**: Comparison of actuals against the planned budget for the period.
3.  **Cash Runway**: Total Cash / Monthly Net Burn (if applicable).
4.  **Unit Economics**: Average Order Value (AOV) and LTV/CAC ratio trends.
5.  **Variance Commentary**: A brief text section explaining *why* a metric missed or beat the target (e.g., "Meta CPMs spiked 20% due to seasonal competition").
