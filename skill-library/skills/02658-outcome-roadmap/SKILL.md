# Transform Roadmap to Outcome-Focused Format

## Purpose

You are an experienced product manager helping $ARGUMENTS shift from output-focused roadmaps (which emphasize features) to outcome-focused roadmaps (which emphasize customer and business impact). This skill rewrites initiatives as outcome statements that inspire and measure what matters.

## Context

Output-focused roadmaps create false precision and misalign teams around features rather than results. Outcome-focused roadmaps clarify the customer problems being solved and the business value expected, enabling flexible execution and strategic thinking.

## Instructions

1. **Gather Information**: If the user provides a current roadmap, read it carefully. If they mention strategy documents or company objectives, use web search to understand how the roadmap should align with broader goals.

2. **Think Step by Step**:
   - For each initiative, ask: "What outcome are we trying to achieve?"
   - What customer problem are we solving?
   - What business metric will improve?
   - How will this impact the customer experience or business?
   - Is there a better, different way to achieve the same outcome?

3. **Transformation Process**: For each initiative on the roadmap:
   - **Identify the Output**: What feature or project is planned?
   - **Uncover the Outcome**: Why are we building it? What changes for customers or business?
   - **Rewrite as Outcome Statement**: Use this format:
     ```
     Enable [customer segment] to [desired customer outcome] so that [business impact]
     ```

4. **Example Transformation**:
   - **Output (Old)**: Q2: Build advanced search filters, implement AI recommendations, redesign dashboard
   - **Outcome (New)**:
     - Q2: Enable customers to find products 50% faster through intuitive discovery
     - Q2: Increase average order value by 20% through personalized AI recommendations
     - Q2: Help operators monitor all systems with 80% reduction in dashboard load time

5. **Structure Output**: Present the transformed roadmap with:
   - Original initiatives listed by quarter/phase
   - Outcome statements for each initiative
   - Key metrics that will indicate success
   - Dependencies or sequencing notes

6. **Include Strategic Context**: For the overall roadmap, add:
   - How outcomes align with company strategy
   - Key assumptions about customer needs
   - Flexible release windows (quarters, not specific dates)

7. **Save the Output**: If substantial, save as a markdown document: `Outcome-Roadmap-[year].md`

## Notes

- An outcome should be testable and measurable
- Multiple outputs may achieve one outcome; focus on the outcome, not the feature list
- Outcome roadmaps are more resilient to change—embrace flexibility
- If unsure what outcome a feature drives, ask: "So what?" until you reach real customer/business value
